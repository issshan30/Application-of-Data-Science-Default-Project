       "['I am really at a loss to express how disappointing this product was.To start off, I am extremely tech-savvy and my home is wired with a good 40+ z-wave, Insteon, Hue, and Zigbee devices.  I also have extensive experience in electrical engineering.Right off the bat, the first Ring doorbell I received would not charge via hardwire.  This was a brand-new installation with a new transformer, new resistor, and all voltages confirmed with a volt meter.  I spent a good 45 minutes waiting on the phone with Ring tech support to get the inevitable conclusion that this was a defective unit.  But instead of just swapping it out right there on the phone, they first wanted me to send back the mounting plate, wait for a new one to be shipped, try the new mounting plate, call back if there was a problem, and THEN they would ship out a new unit.  That was very disappointing customer service from the beginning.Luckily, Amazon came to the rescue and shipped out a brand new unit overnight to replace the defective Ring unit.One would think this would solve the problem but alas, no.  TWO DEFECTIVE UNITS IN A ROW that would not charge via hard wire.  Thinking that there was some freak problem with the transformer, I borrowed a friend\\'s Ring doorbell.  Boom--charged right away.  So yes, I ended up with two bum units in a row.  That should never happen.Setting aside the double hardware failure, a few other major gripes:1)  The Android software for this is absolutely awful.  It is incredibly slow, buggy, and crashes frequently.  And good luck trying to use the \"Live View\" feature.  It takes at least 30 seconds to connect to the doorbell and again, crashes the app the majority of the time. The frustration level is just off the charts and I cannot believe the app ever made it out of beta.2) The Ring does not play well with two or more devices.  I have an iPad permanently mounted in my living room for all types of home automation, including the Ring app.  The Ring app is always open in the background obviously.  Apparently if you have one Ring app opened somewhere and you then try to open it on another device (such as my phone when I\\'m out of the house)--crash.  How is this possible?3) This is just personal, but the actual doorbell sound on this thing is really jarring and there\\'s no way to change it to anything else.  That should be a basic feature.4)  The interface is slow, slow, slow.This looked like such a wonderful product on the surface but was an utter disappointment.  I\\'ll be returning the second defective unit.',\n",
       " \"I was initially happy with the product; arrived quickly and was very easy to install and connect to wifi. I subscribed for the data storage fee of $3/month. I hardwired mine, so battery was never an issue. Enjoyed it at first, primarily from the novelty of the experience. I travel regularly, and liked the ability to give the impression that someone is home and/or watching all the time. However, connection was slow, such that by the time I could connect remotely after a motion alert, there was no longer anyone there. Likewise, no matter how I set the sensitivity, the video would start recording only after a person was already on my front porch, or worse, already walking away. The biggest disappointment and what I will allow to be my last, was that less than two months after the one-year warranty ran out, my doorbell dropped its connection to my wifi, permanently. I called customer service, and they tried for about a half hour to talk me through re-establishing the connection, but ultimately told me that, sorry, it's defective and can't be fixed. Because the warranty had JUST expired, I was told that my only option was to buy another one. After that experience, who would think this was a good idea? So I bought a $200 paperweight a little more than a year ago. Great.\",\n",
       " \"Literally just installed and caught someone stealing our packages the same day. Sent video to our local police and they currently have them in custody. Found out they were also stealing our mail and trying to use our credit cards.The only thing I have issue with is that it is not able to tilt or move so camera is not able to show packages on the floor.Another issue is that if you want to change internet connection you have do take the whole thing down and do set up all over again.Overall it's one of the best purchases we've ever made.\",\n",
       " \"Writing this review the morning after it took someone about 20 seconds to disable and steal our Ring Doorbell. Camera triggered too late to get a look at the person stealing it, speaker feature hung up and didn't activate (like usual) and it was gone from my house in a shockingly short amount of time.Prior to today,I've always been a bit disappointed at the delay in the motion sensor in triggering the camera. I get quite a few packages weekly, and 90% of the time the camera doesn't activate until someone is walking away from the door. Sure enough, last night, it did not activate until the moment someone was putting their hand over the camera. When my husband tried to speak over it the app, as usual, it delayed and did not activate when it should have. Within 20 seconds the camera went dead. Doorbell gone, hole in my wall as well as feelings of security. When put to the test, it failed at every measure. Camera did not trigger in time to get any view of the person at my door, ability to speak through it didn't work (on an iPhone 7 - current phone, updated), and it was gone from my house in less than a minute. So basically my Ring Doorbell let's me know when a car drives down the street, but when I need it to do what I bought it to do, it fails.\",\n",
       " \"So got my doorbell and had it hardwired...good to go right? Well, a few months later the motion sensor and the live view stopped working. So I called Tech Support and found out that even with hard-wiring, the battery will run out of gas and need to be recharged. This requires removing the unit and jacking in the battery with a USB cord.Nowhere on the APP is there a indicator that shows that the battery is getting low! So we could be traveling in vacation and all of a sudden without any warning the ring doesn't work!! Imagine that?Checked the box and couldn't find any mention of this important safety non-feature of the doorbell. I like the product but am extremely disappointed in the fact that it can stop working at anytime without pre-warning.\",\n",
       " \"I've owned the Ring Video doorbell for about 6 months and it has been a very pleasant experience. It was very easy to install and easy to use. It has never stopped working or had any major issues. This doorbell lets me know when I get packages delivered, when people approach my door, or ring my doorbell. It is very convenient. The only issue I've had is with motion sensitivity. I get a ton of motion notifications from cars on the road, which are about 35 feet away from the doorbell. It seems very accurate with detecting people but it has an issues with cars, especially large vehicles.PROS:Easy to setupEasy to useReliable with good wifi signalConvenientCONS:Motion is too sensitive to vehicles on the roadA bit pricey\",\n",
       " 'The product works as advertised. I have installed several of these at friends and family homes. For this product recording is activated ONLY based on motion detection. But in practical usage its usefulness varies.Attached video demonstrates a shortcoming where there is a delay when the recording started after the motion was detected. Due to this delay the face of the thief is not recorded. Because of this we had to recommend one install a security cam which has always live cloud recording. This helps in identifying the culprits. None the less Ring Doorbell helps in confirming the theft recorded in other security cam.Another practical issue is that a strong wifi signal is key for this product to work properly. If the wifi signal drops below -50dBm the notifications are delayed or never received. At some locations I had install wifi extenders or mount the Ring Doorbell at different location where signals were strong. This can also vary depending on the number of wifi signals that may interfere with speed of notifications.',\n",
       " 'So this Ring Video Doorbell worked for about 4 months. I came home one day and the door bell button was stuck in the down position and the unit burned out. I contacted Ring and customer service was receptive and sent me a replacement unit. Unfortunately the replacement unit had trouble connecting to my solid wi-fi and I was directed to reboot the unit by holding down the orange button for 20 seconds. After the unit was rebooted it connected to wi-fi but would not charge or ring my mechanical door chime. My unit was hardwired to my doorbell using a 16 volt transformer and mechanical door bell and the first unit worked fine until it burned out. I spent some time on chat with customer service going through all the troubleshooting when they eventually agreed to send another replacement unit.Fast forward a week and I received the replacement unit and it was DOA (Dead On Arrival). No sign of life. I even stuck it on a wall charger for a couple of hours as instructed and nothing.$200 for the unit and $30 for the Video Storage and access and nothing to show for it. I had high hopes for this device but have lost confidence in it. At this point I would say steer clear of this product or look at alternatives.Amazon will not let me return the item as it is after their refund period so now I am at the mercy of Ring to see what will happen. I emailed Ring customer service and advised them of the recent failure and  will update this review when/if I get a response.',\n",
       " 'I have had my Ring Doorbell since November 2016. I have written very few reviews on Amazon and actually wasn\\'t going to write one for this even though I am pretty disappointed with it. In the beginning I could have written about the horrendous customer service; the fact my original questions had to be asked several times before they decided to actually answer the questions posed to customer service and not the questions they thought I had asked. That I let slide. The amazing amount of effort it took to simply switch the doorbell from one network to another, that was a fun few hours of spinning lights and patience. It does work, I have videos and alerts and the picture quality is good for what the device is. All of the minor frustrations I was o.k with, it was a burgeoning technology and there were bound to be hiccups. However from the beginning the sensors for motion have always been a little off, cars traveling on the street would trigger it but not me or my girlfriend coming in and out of the house. I adjust the sensitivity/range and the same issue. Car 40 feet away? Video! Me on the porch with the dogs? Nothing! Again, not worth writing a review. Then the \"Welcome to Our Neighborhood\" sign was stolen. From our front yard, in plain view of the doorbell, maybe 15 feet away with the range maxed out. Woke up to no sign, however the doorbell had several fantastic night vision videos of several cars that had passed between 2000 hours the night before and 0700 when I looked outside. Fantastic.',\n",
       " 'First off, the Ring is very cool. I really like it and many people  that come to my front door (salespeople) know what it is immediately and don\\'t bother me. There are three problems however, one very serious (in my opinion).1 - The motion function engages when people are walking away, not when they walk up. MANY of my videos are of people\\'s backsides. I don\\'t know if this is a software issue or what.  Tried increasing the sensitivity to the point where I was grabbing cars driving down the street but still only got people leaving my front door. Weird.2 - This kind of goes along with #2. You cannot access the doorbell with security software like Blue Iris,et.al. Now, I get that they want to sell you their Cloud service and I\\'m ok with $30 / year to have an off-site backup. But if you could link the doorbell into your security system you would have an actual video of everything in your possession and you could access it from any computer in the world. That would be REALLY handy for police investigations and any legal hassles that may come your way.3 - If you do not answer the alert fast enough, you are locked out-- even though someone is standing at your front door. You cannot \"turn on\" the camera from your phone or tablet. If someone is there and you do not have an \"ACCEPT\" button on the screen, there is just no way to  see or talk to them. This is obviously a software flaw. You should always be able to \"wake\" a camera remotely and talk to a person at your front door. Or maybe you just want to see the view outside your front door. You should be able to access the camera / microphone and enjoy your front yard.Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the future.Update 1/24/16 - I have found a fantastic use for the Ring Doorbell and Chime. My mother-in-law, now in her 90s, lives by herself. She has become hard-of-hearing and often does not hear the doorbell. By installing the Ring on her door, she now is bothered much less (solicitors tend to recognize it and don\\'t seem to like it) and when someone rings the bell, the Chime, placed by her favorite chair, gives her a better chance of hearing someone at the door.I think the Chime would be MUCH improved if it had an ultra-brite LED on top (that you could turn on or off) that would flash when the bell rings. In addition, I REALLY like that I now know when people come to her door and I can talk to them before she answers the door. It gives me a much stronger sense of security for her.Update 3/24/16 - Ring has added “Live View” to their feature set. It allows you to access your Ring Doorbell any time you wish. This solves the problem with #3 as long as you are not on battery power. Obviously, it also lets you “dial in” any time you wish to check out your front or back yard (where ever your doorbell is). This is a feature that I like as every once in a while I just like to see if its raining or foggy at the house.',\n",
       " 'If you live anywhere that the temp ever gets down to freezing or below - read this! I used to be the BIGGEST supporter of this device. I told everyone about it. Showed videos all the time. Talked about how great it was. Then winter came.Let me first say that I purchased this device so I would know who\\'s around my house when I\\'m not home. That was my first priority. The novelty of not needing to get up to see who\\'s at the door when I AM at home was just a secondary benefit. The cute videos of my family and friends making jokes was of course a close third.Now, let\\'s get back to the cold weather. I live in Wisconsin. What do we do in winter when it\\'s zero degrees out? We go on vacation to somewhere warm. That said, on a recent vacation to a warm climate I attempted to view my videos from Ring. I was prompted by an alert when I clicked on the app, it was warning me my battery was critically low. How could that be? I wondered. My device is hard wired. I hard wired it so I would never have to worry about charging the battery. Charging the battery would require using the special tool to remove the device and then bringing it inside, charging it and then taking it back outside. Hard wired was definitely the way to go. Or so I thought. Anyways, I clicked on the warning and then realized not every video had footage or they were \"frozen\", kinda like everything else outside.Being concerned about the poor quality and the lack of a charge on a hard wired unit I sent an email to Ring. I\\'ve actually exchanged several with them. I\\'ve gotten a few different responses, lots of misunderstanding from them and no resolution that is satisfactory.Bottom line is this:They aren\\'t meant for cold weather, even if they are hard wired. So, if you\\'re going to go on vacation or ever leave your house in cold weather don\\'t expect to count on this device as your eyes and ears while you are away.It\\'s unfortunate. I otherwise really (did) like this. Thankfully I hadn\\'t yet purchased the stuck up cams that I was going to use for each side of the house.I\\'ve included pics of one response from them on the topic as well as the faq from their site. Yes, the FAQ should have been a warning to me before I purchased it. The performance though seems to be even less than expected the email also gives lower expectations.',\n",
       " \"After the 30 day free cloud trial, there is NO VIDEO unless you subscribe - so this is NOT a stand alone product with even a single day of built in video memory.  Interesting that when many find that out after the 30 days free cloud trial is up, that's also when you've missed your Amazon return window.  The android app is buggy and refuses to provide a ring tone on my S5 although all permissions were allowed on this app.  And BTW, the app even installs without any default sound selected - which in my case makes no difference anyway since choosing a ring tone or verbal announcement  doesn't work.  And last but not least, you must unscrew and remove the doorbell to charge it.  When I turned on 'live motion detection'  the battery drained to 80%  in just 3 days.  It's going back.......\",\n",
       " \"I wish I would have spent the extra money for the newer model. My main issue is that the motion will pick up cars driving by on the street 20 yards away, but hardly ever get people walking on the sidewalk just feet from my door, and sometimes I will even get up to the second step of my doorstep only a couple feet from the thing and do a dance and it literally wont get it till I am within a foot of the doorbell.These issues are intermittent and that's the annoying thing. At one point I had it dialed in to not get the cars on the parking lot, but then it would only ever get people if they were literally knocking on the door already, and I don't mean the delay, I mean you could stand there for as long as you want, but till you are right up near the door it wont sense you. Then I dialed it out and eliminated the whole middle section, and that helped with the cars. but because the leftover motion zone was so limited, it would only capture people once they were already past my door. (I live in a townhome, and there is a main walk about 7 feet from my front door).The motion response time, and even the doorbell ring time is so delayed that I will almost always get just the back of people as they go away, even watching the videos after. I know part of it is that my situation isn't perfect for this, being that it only takes a couple seconds to be out of vew of my door and then knocking on it, but still I wish that at least the time from motion to recording was faster, cause then I could at least watch the after videos to see what happened.Like mentioned before, the main thing that bugs me, is I have the motion settings set to only about 10 feet, but they wont get the sidewalk 7 feet away, and only get the road 20-30 yards away every time.My other issue is that this thing is massive. I suppose that may be helpful as a deterrent, but still its a bit of an eyesore up on my porch.This is still a pretty good product, and I feel safer having it on my door, but I wish I would have just spent the extra money fro the upgraded model.\",\n",
       " 'Update Jan 2018:I\\'m giving up on these. I had two of them (this and a Ring 2) and they both miserably fail to do their job properly. Frequent disconnects from the network (when I know the network is fine), several minute delay of relaying a ring to the chime and phones, not announcing that batteries are about to go (so they don\\'t work for days until someone knocks and I know the doorbell is no longer online because of the battery), and I can\\'t use them at all to detect motion due to its inferior motion detection system, abysmal interface and total lack of options for mounting and software knobs to achieve a somewhat sane surveillance mode, so it\\'s just an expensive doorbell, nothing else. Doesn\\'t even work half of the time. Two different models! I have to say that customer service, once I escalated the original issue, was superb in that they tried replacing the original one and then were nice enough to send me a Ring 2 without charge. Sadly, the product is not on par with this. I can\\'t wait for the Blink version to come out to try that, but for now I\\'ll go back to my simple, dumb 20 bucks doorbell set. This one never failed me, once:\\xa0SadoTech Model CX Wireless Doorbell with 1 Receiver Plugin and 2 Remote Buttons Operating at over 500-feet Range with Over 50 Chimes, No Batteries Required for Receiver, (White), Fixed Code C SeriesJune 2017:When I first installed the door bell it worked somewhat great, with all the motion detection bells and whistles turned on. I also have a Chime so I can hear if someone rings the doorbell without having to rely on my phone all the time, and added the 30 bucks a year subscription to save motion/ring events in the cloud.After a few months the nightmare of constant noise/notifications from motion alerts started. Nothing had changed. Neither the position of the device, the settings, or frequency of traffic. I emailed support, which was an utterly disappointing experience.They first tried to get me to change the settings to make it less chatty. When I questioned that, they tried to explain how the motion detection works and that the range control doesn\\'t actually control the range but size of heat signatures picked up by the motion sensor. Say what? Fine. Don\\'t care, just tell me how to fix it. They recommended pointing it down a bit more (by buying one of their wedge kits), which I did. No change. Change settings again, no change. I recommended to add a still image behind the range settings screen at some point so I don\\'t have to keep printing out screenshots of the range settings view and a live view screen to overlay them (which apparently, since the range doesn\\'t do what it says on the tin, is utterly useless anyway) - ignored (this is of course reserved for the more premium model).Multiple back and forth emails later and I still can\\'t use motion detection (which now also seems to eat up all the battery every 2-3 weeks - because for whatever reason motion detection and silent reporting still happens even if it\\'s \"turned off\"). They continuously fail to address my concern that nothing has changed on my end and it has to be a camera/doorbell issue. When I cancelled my subscription and asked if I can get a partial refund, they stopped responding altogether.I\\'m about to ditch this thing, go back to my cheap wireless doorbell and add a SmartThings integrated camera to watch over the front porch. This product is utterly useless for this purpose, and I don\\'t need a brick as a doorbell that needs to be charged every three weeks.For a device that costs 200 bucks (I include the cost for the video storage subscription here) I expect more - it should work, I shouldn\\'t have to learn or understand the inner workings of the motion detection mechanism, the UX should be intuitive, I expect decent battery life, proper and working functionality, and customer service should be stellar. None of that applies, unfortunately.Update from June 2017: After I could not find any setting to quiet down the motion notifications, customer service kindly sent a replacement and I returned the original. Unfortunately the same issues are still happening.I just can\\'t seem to find any setting that\\'s not going to make the doorbell go after every car going by even with the motion detection turned off. I have it set to the least sensitive settings, purchased a wedge kit to point it downward to avoid the street, and changed motion zones to all conceivable options, all to no avail. All points to software faults at this point (and perhaps systemic hardware design issues as well).The device is therefore useless for me for the following points:* I can not turn off the motion detection completely, even if I turn it off on the app it still triggers. It\\'s ridiculous that turning it off doesn\\'t work or is just per app suppression of notifications!* My partner\\'s phone app which I have shared the door bell with also has the motion detection turned off but still gets the notifications.* The constant reacting to motion drains the battery - I don\\'t have a regular doorbell outlet and am not willing to invest in custom wiring to feed it with power. That\\'s the whole reason I\\'ve bought this device so I can be independent of a power supply!I am extremely unhappy with this.',\n",
       " 'UNRELIABLE! After installing the new Ring Pro doorbell, it was working for about 2 weeks. Then it just stopped working. The problem is that it stopped working after Ring pushed an automatic update to the doorbell (BTW there is no option to control this). So the doorbell doesn\\'t work.Takes hours to reach the customer service. They tell me that there is some \"trending problem\", and promise it\\'ll be fixed that evening. After 3 days, NOTHING, still broken! They don\\'t even push an email to existing customers apologizing, or notifying of the issue as a courtesy. It\\'s been 3 days with a completely broken doorbell. Nest, alarm systems, etc. always work; this Ring does not. You don\\'t realize how much of a problem a broken doorbell presents until... it\\'s broken! Kids, friends, deliveries, etc. Remember, you have to pay someone to install, AND re-install your old doorbell. This went into a stucco painted wall, so putting back the original doorbell is expensive. Don\\'t waste your time and $$$.',\n",
       " 'Here’s what happened in my house yesterday. Some thief stole my Ring Doorbell and did a factory reset, then put it under their account and deleted all the historical videos from there, obviously including their footprint caught by Ring.The whole process is so easy that it doesn’t require any permission from my end. The only notification I got was an email saying, “Your Ring Device Has Changed Ownership”, after the device has been transferred to their account and I already lost access to it.I’ve had Ring Doorbell and Ring stickup camera for over a year with their Protect Plus Plan which stated, “Your Ring videos are stored in the cloud for up to 60 days (in the USA).” However, Ring Support Team told me the videos are gone and they couldn’t recover it. They do offer free replacement on stolen device, which I appreciated, but now I’m seriously concerned with the functionality of this product.1.  As a security product, why Ring allows factory reset and change of ownership without account holder’s permission? If there’s a permission requirement sent to me (like most security system do nowadays), then I will have opportunity to deny it before they can delete the videos.2. Since I paid the Protect Plus Plan under my account, I would assume the videos stored in the cloud are associated to my account not with the device. Even if they can delete the video locally stored on the device, why they can delete those stored in the cloud, which supposedly been protected under my account?The logic behind security products like Ring is that you pay for emergency situations like this. If the system only works when nothing happened but failed when thief coming, I don’t think anybody should waste their money.',\n",
       " 'The Ring video doorbell is a solid choice for people looking to get into smart home technology, and provides security, peace of mind, and ease of use that is not present in many other options at this price point. I’ll go by claim-by-claim to evaluate how well this product lives up to the manufacturer’s claims.SEE, HEAR, AND SPEAK: This works, but your mileage may vary. You will need to have a very solid WiFi connection to the Ring, so make sure it is close enough to one of your WiFi points (or an extender/Chime Pro) so that it can handle an audio and video stream. It can take a few seconds to establish the connection if you’re powering it from a battery, causing a slight delay when trying to see motion/ring activity or speak with someone at the camera. Additionally, I found the volume on the Ring to be fairly quiet, and I see visitors leaning into the doorbell in video recordings where I speak with them.GET INSTANT ALERTS: This works flawlessly for me - when it works. I get motion and doorbell alerts instantaneously, notifying me of movement on my porch or visitors/delivery people pressing the button to ring the doorbell. I have to admit that Ring sometimes misses motion on my porch, but this is due to sensitivity and zone settings, which I must finely tune due to my proximity to a busy street. Those located away from busy streets will likely not have this problem.WATCH IN CRYSTAL-CLEAR HD VIDEO: Ring falls short here. While it is technically HD at 720p, it looks much lower quality in my installed location. It is not terribly grainy or pixellated, but it is not video quality worthy of preservation or bragging. It does the job, but the promotional videos you see on TV or their website are not indicative of the actual video quality you will experience. I’ll sum it up as “fine.”PROTECT YOUR HOME WITH INFRARED VISION: Reliably switches between infrared and no infrared depending on ambient lighting. A noticeable clicking sound occurs when the camera begins recording at night, which I have seen scare away someone thinking about lurking on my porch. It is loud enough to be heard outside near a busy street, but does not detract from the experience.COMMUNICATE W/ VISITORS - TWO-WAY AUDIO: Again, Ring falls short here. Audio works, but everyone that has used it when pressing the Ring’s button has been either disappointed by the volume and voice quality, or was nearly unable to hear me entirely. Everyone leans in if I try and talk to them, and I must talk at an uncomfortably loud volume to be heard properly. Apparently it has noise cancellation, but this is not noticeable to me, so I can’t imagine how bad the sound quality would be without it.LIVE VIEW: It works, but is not super useful for me. It takes forever to power up Live View on battery power, making it nearly useless if you are trying to get to it quickly. I have other security cameras installed on my porch that run on batteries and come up more quickly, so I rely on them instead of Ring for a quick view of my porch.SETUP IN MINUTES: This is highly subjective and depends on what your mounting surface is made out of. Mine is brick, and it took me “minutes”, but closer to 45 of them than single-digit. If you’re mounting into siding or wood it will be considerably faster, but I had to drill pilot holes and then size them properly for the anchors before finally installing the Ring. Not super fun.DUAL-POWERED: My home didn’t have a doorbell so I rely solely on battery power. While I am glad it has a battery, I wish it lasted longer. Realistically, I get about a month of battery life before I must recharge it. Admittedly, this is because my Ring records about 4 events every hour, since the street in front of my house has city buses that drive by about this often. I wish I had known about the wedge mounts before drilling holes into my brick exterior, because I’m not drilling more to install the wedge kit now.Overall the Ring video doorbell is a solid product. I took a star off for the video and audio quality, as they are nowhere near close to what is represented in marketing materials. Everything else works about as well as I would expect, and I am happy with my purchase. One of the biggest selling points is that you can power this entirely by rechargeable battery, so it can be mounted basically anywhere!',\n",
       " 'I have only been using the Ring for a couple of weeks now but so far it seems worth the cost.  I don\\'t mind the $30 per year cloud storage fee as I\\'d much rather not have to house the hours of video data this thing records each day in being at the front door.  Installation wasn\\'t difficult once we determined we had the right configs.  Things you should know:1) we tested ring out of the box after a full charge (the ring button will fully circle with blue light when comeplete) and it worked like a dream.  Good picture, although fish eyed, even in the dark.  That surprised me.2) we then installed the ring hard wired to our existing doorbell. The doorbell worked, but the Ring video and motion/button notification no longer did.3) we checked the long list of compatible doorbells that you can find on the Ring website.  While the advertising and box says it works with virtually every doorbell... It doesn\\'t.  We have a Nutone bell. Fairly common.  Doesn\\'t work with ring. I was determined to get this thing working.4) went to Best Buy and purchased the Ring chime.  It\\'s a plug in ring chime that allows you to install the Ring without hardwiring to your existing doorbell.  So we have the Ring doorbell screwed in to the same place on the doorframe, but the wires are capped off and not connected to Ring. Plugged in and synced up the chime to wifi and it worked.  It\\'s very loud.  You can also hear the Ring chime outside pretty loud so with that plus the Ring chime on every phone, iPad, etc in your house... Maybe not necessary to have the Chime unless you have a 4000+ sq ft house or don\\'t have phones, tablets or computers with Ring app on them near you.  But the plug in Chime was only $30.  To me less hassle and cost than buying and installing a compatible doorbell transformer.5) Ring began working like a champ.  Then it grew increasingly unpredictable.  We played with the motion settings, decreased it so that cars going by wouldn\\'t alert us of motion at the door, etc.  Butterflies set it off; they say it\\'s heat sensored; not sure butterflies are warm inside, but I digress.  It still works when it needs to \"most\" of the time.6) As a doorbell, it\\'s flawless.  If someone pushes the button, the video begins.  Talking to the visitor is clear and easy to accomplish.  This is the best feature of the doorbell.7) motion is hit or miss.  It works, maybe not always, but enough to give me peace of mind on top of my other home security without video capabilities.  Sure I get video at 4am of nothing, so if you are a scared woman living alone this may freak you out more than it helps, but for people with latchkey kids or teens that you want to keep an eye on in terms of verifying they\\'re home or that unwelcome visitors aren\\'t at your home, this is excellent. For people who get deliveries while at work or out of town, or folks who can\\'t get up to answer the door, excellent. To keep intruders at bay... Eh, there are better surveillance systems out there for that.8) the live view feature does not work if you set up using the not-hard-wired method.  So if doing what I did and using the Ring chime, you will not be able to view live feed from your doorbell.  You\\'ll need the stick up cam.  Didn\\'t know this until after I did all of the above to get this thing functioning.  But, we ended up buying a Ring stick up cam after all to get a better view of the opposite side of our home since the view from Ring is blocked... and we love it. Use it daily. It\\'s motion detection is actually a bit more sensitive but that\\'s okay.  We drilled a small hole in our garage door wall to hard wire electricity to the stick uo cam as it works hard every day and loses battery life in less than 2 months for us. Don\\'t depend on the battery. It will drive you nuts.  Or get the solar charger panel.All in all, I\\'m happy we made this purchase.  I wonder is the newer version really worth it for \"better\" video quality.  This one doesn\\'t nearly give out 720p so I\\'m guessing the new version saying 1080p is more like 720. The newer version had some bad reviews in terms of functionality and quality of the doorbell itself so I went with the longer-tested, older version and am quite pleased.  So far so good and worth $200 IMO.  We are still playing with doorbell types and have yet to find one that works after trying two different mechanical transformers.  Customer service was less than helpful and referred us back to the list of tested doorchimes.  If you have one that is not on the compatibility list, chances are it will not work hard wired and you will need the Ring chime.  And again, know that the live feed will not work.  Also concerning charging, it of course depends upon your usage but with a few notifications per day, we notice the battery has drained down about 8% over the last few weeks.  I suspect it will need to be unscrewed and put on the charger within the next 5 months or so at this rate.  If you are hardwiring, it will charge itself.  If you are using the Ring chime and not hardwiring, you will need to charge it using the included USB charger, so expect having to remove it from the front porch every 5-7 months or thereabouts if using this method.  Also don\\'t be afraid to keep playing with the settings... we have managed to get it pretty close to perfect over the last few weeks.  It takes some trial & error.  It still misses some movement, and still picks up nothing... but it\\'s better to have than not, IMO.',\n",
       " \"Installed this a week ago.  Beyond frustrated with it.  The motion detection just doesn't work.  Drives us crazy with too many false alerts (at least 10 a day) or just complete failures (misses mailman entirely every day and won't pick me up at all no matter how much I jump around in front of it).  When it does happen to work it takes at least 2 min to engage and alert us.  By then the person is gone.  Don't blame our wifi.  We have best hi speed offered by ATT and the router is 5 feet away.  Final note:  the design is visually flawed.  It doesn't look like a doorbell so no one uses it.  looks more like a video camera than a doorbell so everyone sees it but knocks on the door anyway instead of pushing it.  We really wanted this to work as we need this level of security at the entry but this just won't do the job.  P.S.  minor issue but now I will have to repair 4 large holes I had to drill into the stucco to mount it.  If you really want to buy this to try it out I highly recommend a temporary attachment of some kind for at least the first few days before committing to a more permanent mount it might save you the hassle of a repair when you inevitably return it.\",\n",
       " 'I had my ring for little over 2 years and often had issues with the device. Several times,we have had to remove and reset the device. Most recently (in thelast 2 weeks or so) I started getting blank recorded videos (completely black).  I opened a support ticket and I was told they\\'re aware of the issue and I was asked to charge the unit in the house outlet and also perform a reset.  Which I did, but still continue to have same issue.  After going through those two steps provided by the ring support team, the frequency of these blank videos went up.  Finally they told me I need to replace the unit.  here is their exact email...\"I’d be more than happy to replace your Doorbell, but I can see that it isn’t under standard 1 year manufacturer warranty\"  and my follow up question to them was...am i expected to replace the unit every 2 years and I was told \"The lifetime of the Ring products is more than three years.\" Clearly, they have work to do to get the product up to speed. It’s too expensive to have to replace every 2 years.I really liked the unit while it was working, but am just little frustrated by their support and customer service.',\n",
       " 'Arrived on time and well packaged.  Instructions were clear and the App was easy to install on my iphone.  Easy to install, and looked great.  The video would pixel and could not clearly show a person if there was light behind the target;  but it was marginally passable.  The audio was just awful.  You could not understand anyone at the door, and they could not understand you.  The audio kept breaking up.  I insured that we were linked on my Netgear router and not my Almond expander.  No change.  I contacted customer support and they basically advised me to reboot the Ring -- that is go thru the setup sequence again.  Did that and no change.  I thought I would work on it later, and then discovered it would not alert me that there was someone standing at the door -- the motion sensor feature did not work well.  Really disappointed.',\n",
       " 'I bought this back in the fall of 2016. It worked great! I didn’t like that I had to pay a fee per year, but I paid the $30/year.  I had it hardwired to the house, but would have to charge the Ring during our cold winters (-20). That was fine. Then for some reason my live view stopped working. It was hard wired and it said I had 0% battery.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with there troubleshooting team. I factory reset it once, I did the normal reset five times and the answer was—- I have to buy their upgraded protection service for $100 per year. Not happy. Not happy at all. I might as well buy a new Eing every other year for the price they want me to pay for a warranty. How about a product that works???',\n",
       " \"When it works, it's really cool. The video and audio quality are good, and the interfaces easy to use. The online record is easy to access via the phone or web. We can see who came. We have a recording of one oddball coming to the door that I'm happy to have to provide police in case something bad happens. We've been able to confirm that some commitments people have made were actually met. However, it often fails to detect motion, even when someone has passed right in front of it. There are times when we'll come and go right past it, and it will capture nothing. We're probably averaging about a 75% success rate currently. Yes, yes, we've tried changing the settings and re-testing - between 5 and 10 times. At some point, it just gets old. The more devices I buy, the more time I spend taking care of them, and the less time I have for anything else. After a while I think maybe I exist to serve them, and not the other way around. I don't regret this purchase, but I'm conflicted about recommending it.\",\n",
       " 'Here\\'s a real world review from a verified purchaser that has above average technical ability.I purchased the Ring Video Doorbell on Amazon in 2016 because it was the only unit available in Brass. Living in a condominium complex there are very few things you are allowed to update esthetically. My Brass finish matched perfectly and I have never received a complaint.Pros. Easy setup, seriously easy. Easy install, even using existing wiring. Video quality is awesome. I loved that I could stretch and zoom the video on my iPhone to scan the neighborhood. Also, I am a professional video surveillance designer and installer, I was blown away with the night vision abilities of this unit. Astounding.Cons. Internal battery. Sounds wrong, doesn\\'t it? Well, most lithium ion batteries are rated for 12 months (1 Year) of continuous use. The superior brands are rated, but not guaranteed, for 24 months (2 Years). Ever notice after about 1 year your cellphone starts to suck and after 2 years it\\'s pretty much useless... unless tethered. Well, my Ring Video Doorbell at 2 years officially exploded. I attempted to access some video online and noticed it was a month old. I then tried to view online and it reported device is not connected to wifi. I retrieved the instructions for reconnecting to wifi and as I removed the device I noticed many issues. Primarily the installation screws where basically a Corel reef of rust and the brass finish was bubbled up from the inside out. The backplate contacts where worn and some protected areas where now exposed. I understand that this can happen, but trust me when I say it shouldn\\'t. The professional grade units I install are rated for 5 years, I guess since I originally paid more for the Ring Video Doorbell I expected more.Another con... was promised live access and Apple TV integration. After about 6 months I had live integration and was very pleased to have the ability to check on my house while out of the country. Contacted Ring about Apple TV integration and was told \"We have a newer unit to be released soon and it has the ability to be answered with your Apple TV 4\" - Really!The BIGEST con of the system is speed. I have a well above average internet connection. I currently run at 200Mbps download and 15Mbps upload. These speeds, even in the house, I never established a connection quick enough to actually speak to anyone. When I ever attempted to answer the Ring Video Doorbell it would not fully connect for up to 3 minutes, which is apparently way too long for UPS to wait.In short, don\\'t waist your money. There are many cheaper solutions now that work as well or better. Find a unit that has no or changeable batteries and you should seriously consider one with a Micro SD slot to avoid the $30-120.00 fees.UPDATE -With no request on my part a Ring Representative (Alexis) reached out to me via email and requested a conversation about this review. I honored her request and quite frankly I was surprised Ring would care at all about one little guy and his review. The Ring representative appeared to be fully concerned and wanted a satisfied customer, rare these days.After a brief conversation on the phone the Ring Representative told me they would like to ship me one of their latest models with no lithium battery, hardwired only, completely free of charge and simply test it and provide an unbiased update.I was only concerned because I reside in a condo development that is quite picky about the rules of conformity. All of our units have brass fixtures outside and they maintain a vigilant check on that. The new Ring device is either black, silver or white. I was firstly impressed that it came with the 3 different colored faceplates, simply pick an choose out of the box. I went with white and it actually blends in quite well. Not a single complaint filed. The second thing that impressed me was the wedges included in the box also. In case you don\\'t know this, some doorbells are mounted to a side wall near the front door of the residence and the camera of the Ring device doe not have an alignment ability. Because of this there are mounting wedges to adjust the angle of the camera when surface mounting. What impressed me is that several of my clients required such a wedge and they previously had to be purchased third party or 3D printed yourself. Very nice attention to detail and reviews.What\\'s awesome - the new installation method is extremely, seriously, extremely simple. I had this unit installed and fully configured in under 5 minutes. The day time picture quality has been brilliantly enhanced, so clear even while zooming. The response time has been incredibly rev\\'d up. I walk out my door and a notification immediately announces on my iPhone. This is extremely important to me since Amazon recently began self delivery in my area. In case you are unaware, Amazon self delivery just drops the package at your door. They do not require a signature or even a hand off. The driver approaches the front door, drops your package and takes a photo... done. The actual Ring response is vastly improved as well. Previous model by the time I connected to the device over the internet the person at my door was long gone... no longer the case. Connect time is about 15-25 seconds. The motion zones are also much more customizable then previous models, so now I am only notified when someone is actually near my door. All That being said...The Not So Awesome - Night Vision. Not so great. I will not go so far as to say it\\'s horrible, it\\'s just not as clear and impressive as the past model. Ring has made some changes to their camera, it\\'s obvious, and have offered more extensive settings with Night Vision mode... why? Because they know the new camera does not perform as well at night. Grainy, purple... just bad. Even their B&W mode is blocky. I have a well lit front entrance and I actually had to start turning off my lights to receive a clearer video.On the upside, that\\'s it. The Night Vision is lacking, as far as quality, but that\\'s the only flaw in this system. A+Kudos to Ring and Alexis!',\n",
       " 'Since I installed the ring, the loser, upstairs no longer tampers with my door.  Throwing cigarette buttts and tearing notes off my door, etc.I also feel a little safer when entering and leaving my apartment.  If something should happen, there is always a recording of it online as well as several computers.  I even share the viewing with family members via email inclusion.  I even download to my phone to show the police when I have a problem with the loser upstairs.  This product has been long overdue. Update.  I have gone through approximately 5-6 doorbells sending them back and forth to the company.  What company fails to inform you of is the fact that your wifi can be hacked,  Microsoft released this information recently.  My camera was constantly shut down from some unknown source and I was never given an explanation but put through their generic troubleshooting process to nothingness and sent another camera or charger.  Any computer science student could have just told me what I was trying to understand.  I asked the company if they were willing to work with me on their wired $500 new model and take this one back.  NOPE.  A burglar can remotely and silently shut down these cameras and enter your home without detection.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve cleared out my previous review and this is the final version after having lived with it for some time.In my experience, the camera isn\\'t worth it.  It\\'s neither worth the money, nor the hassle.  I\\'m going to keep it only because I hold out some slim hope that firmware upgrades may improve it to some degree.So there are two main features, the camera and the motion detection.The Camera:The camera is terrible.  They claim 720p, but it comes nowhere near that.  My wifi signal is fine.  I\\'ve been through all of that with their tech support.  I even purchased an extender though I didn\\'t need it.  The video quality has nothing to do with my network speed or my internet speed, period.  I\\'m not sure whether it\\'s the camera itself or that Ring compresses the video to the point it\\'s nearly useless, but either way it\\'s a problem.Real life scenario: Someone comes to the door and I\\'m expecting a package.  The video quality is not good enough to tell if the logo on the person\\'s shirt is USPS or some random sales company.  With a broken leg I stumble to the door thinking it\\'s mail.  Instead it\\'s a sales representative from some random company ignoring my \"no soliciting\" sign.  Thanks, Ring.  I know I should have talked to them through the intercom function first, but still.  They were standing two feet away from the door.  I should have been able to tell that it was not a USPS logo on their shirt.  It was plain to see in person.Another problem with the camera is the autoexposure.  When the recording first starts, it\\'s a huge bloom of white light and very, very slowly it may or may not tone itself down to a usable video.  Whether it turns into something I can view depends on the time of day.  Ring support says it\\'s because the doorbell is mounted underneath a covered porch.  Well, it is.  But the cover only extends 4.5 feet away from the exterior wall.  Many people have covered porches.  Better autoexposure would be faster but would also compensate for that.  Today you can buy a computer that will run Windows for just a few dollars (Raspberry Pi or similar), but this $200 device cannot figure out autoexposure.Motion Detection:This is what will really get on your nerves.  I have been messing with this thing since May.  It\\'s what I hope will be improved with a firmware update, but so far, nothing.First, whenever you change the settings, you have to go to your door and ring the doorbell for them to take effect.  Really?  What if I\\'m away and using the app?  What if it\\'s early in the morning or nighttime and everyone\\'s asleep?  Ridiculous.Secondly, it just doesn\\'t work very well.  The thermal differentiation is a good idea in theory, but either it\\'s not a good idea in practice or Ring has done a poor job implementing it.  I live on a quiet suburban street.  In the months I have this device, I have not been able to find good settings.  Just today a guy came to the door to stick a flier on there, again ignoring my \"no soliciting\" sign.  It didn\\'t pick him up walking across the yard.  It didn\\'t pick him up at all until he was on the porch sticking the flier to my door.  But last week it came on to record two people walking down the street, and not only that, the camera came on when they were in front of my neighbor\\'s house.  It picks up every car that drives by.  Every one except for the mail truck which is the only one I\\'m interested in.  Or the pizza delivery guy.  How it knows to ignore the traffic I actually want to see, I have no idea.  I\\'ve dialed back the settings so that it shouldn\\'t pick up any traffic but nothing works.  It goes off six times an hour sometimes.  Again, this is a slow neighborhood.  That\\'s every car going by.  As I write this it\\'s picked up two.  Sometimes you can\\'t even see the cars at all because of the autoexposure problem.  Sometimes you can but it either came on too late or the picture is still too bright to make out what kind of car it is.  Can\\'t tell a dump truck from a motorcycle and that\\'s no exaggeration.  The only reason I know is because I can hear it from inside or happen to see them through a window.So it\\'s next to useless.  It camera comes on when you don\\'t want it to, and doesn\\'t when it should, or if it does it\\'s really late.  Maybe cooler weather would help.  I live in Dallas, so it\\'s hot and has been hot for a while.  The cars going by are hot.  A human\\'s body temperature is usually going to be very close to or just below the ambient air temperature, which might explain why it doesn\\'t always pick up people on my porch, or takes forever to pick them up.Conclusions: Motion detection that\\'s extremely flawed to the point that it\\'s nearly useless.  Very poor video quality.Redeeming features:So why do I keep it?  Well like I said I think firmware updates can handle some of these issues.  Plus I don\\'t need the money that badly.  Wouldn\\'t buy it if I had to do it over again, but it\\'s not a huge loss.Also, it\\'s probably better than nothing.  Maybe.  The jury is out on that.There may be a deterrent aspect.  People seem to know what it is.  I\\'ve seen people walk up and turn away after looking at it.  It may deter a break in.The intercom feature seems to work well enough.  That\\'s important since you can\\'t ever tell who rings the bell.

       " \"I was very excited when I received my Ring door bell, but that went away fast when I started having problem after problem. Here is the list:- The unit does not record unless you have a paid cloud account with Ring. Other companies offer free cloud storage (or at least they store your recordings for free the first 24 hours).- My unit is advertised to record in 720P, but it has inferior quality compared to an IP camera that I have with the same resolution.- The device stops recording after 20-30 seconds for battery-operated devices even if physically installed as hardwired (60 seconds option is only for hardwired devices without a battery option).- When you try to answer an event on the app, it takes a while to open and by the time it loads, the person at your door is gone.- When you star an event it saves it, but when I check a few days later is gone, these happened every single time.- Connection to Wi-Fi is not stable, even when my router is less than 10 feet away and I have the Ring device on a designated network with around 64 Mbps download speed and 12 Mbps upload.- After 2 weeks it stopped ringing the chime (which is mechanical and it works fine if I use a regular doorbell push button)- After 3 weeks itworks stopped charging (even though I have 22V coming from the transformer and at the wires connected to the mounting plate/charger) That's when I decided that enough is enough and returned it.- I reached out to customer service a couple of times but they tried to blame my Wi-Fi, my phone or my wiring and couldn't offer any help.I would like to add that I am an IT professional with Network and Low Voltage experience and I did extensive troubleshooting to no avail, including:- Restarted Wi-Fi router and monitored connection speeds and bandwidth, which checked okay.- Restarted phone (Samsung S8) uninstalled and reinstall app.- Removed and re-added Ring device a couple of times- Changed transformer. Originally, I had a 16V transformer and upgrade it to 24V, just in case that 16V was not enough juice.- Ran new wiring from Ring device to transformer AND from transformer to Chime. All voltage readings checked okay at every endpoint, and all continuity tests passed.- Replaced the ChimeBottom Line:My main complaint is about the short length of the recordings, which in addition to the lagging on picking up movement, makes a very poor system to detect and record events at your property. All a burglar needs to do is to cover their face for 30 seconds). The company has advertised for a while a new feature (the user ability to control the length of the recordings) but they have not delivered yet. Maybe I got a faulty device, but after reading so many customer reviews about issues with the motion detector feature and other flaws, I will stay away from these kind of devices until the technology has improved. I read about other brands having the same issues as well.\",\n",
       " 'Overall packaging and install went great. Product is cool idea, however, on the product video, they showed the ability to set motion zones on a screenshot of the live stream and this was the main feature that sold me on the product, especially after reading early reviews that state the motion sensor was overactive. I could only access the \"zones\" view and couldn\\'t get the motion activity to stop activating for every single car that passed by. (I know I can turn notifications off, but I\\'d prefer to have my notifications on and for it to work correctly). I have it set to activate for motion activity for somewhere around 10\\' from the Ring unit, however, it\\'s activating for every single passing vehicle at around 20-30\\' from my Ring unit. Because I couldn\\'t figure out how to custom define the area via a screenshot, I tried to contact Ring customer support via their chat dialogue on their site and this is where a frustrating experience got even worse. I entered the chat dialogue and was told to enter my text. Then I sat there awaiting a response on an active chat window for over 5 minutes(closer to 10) without any response or notification that I was in a chat queue. After getting frustrated at waiting for any response or signs of life from their chat, and already being frustrated about the product, I was told to either upgrade to the Ring Pro or basically too bad. I feel like I was bait and switched at this point and even more agitated that they were so non-chalant in their response, especially when I tried to point out that the product video on the listing was inaccurate and about the non-response/non-notification that I wasn\\'t actually on with an agent in chat...that I was just in a queue. They could care less about retaining my business and I could care less about being a Ring evangelist. I couldn\\'t wait to talk to my friends and family and share this awesome device with them...nope. Instead, I\\'ll do the opposite.',\n",
       " \"UPDATE 8-20-2019: This Ring doorbell sucks! The device has an RSSI of 38 which is supposed to be great. I had a package delivered today and the delivery driver walked all the way up to the front door which is about 20 ft in plain view of the Ring doorbell. He set the package on the ground, took a picture of the package, rang the Ring doorbell and walked back to his van. HE NEVER SHOWED UP ON CAMERA, THE RING DOORBELL DID NOT START RECORDING UNTIL HE WAS GONE! This thing is useless.I've had the ring doorbell since Jan 2017 and it's now July 2018, so about a year and a half. I have it hard wire to the doorbell power so it doesn't need batteries. I've had two packages delivered today at different times of the day and I also had someone out to my house to take pictures of a problem area. The problem area is clearly visible to the Ring Doorbell camera but the camera didn't even activate to record the movement so i didn't get a notification at all. When my first package was delivered on my doorstep, directly in front of the Ring Doorbell, I didn't get a notification nor did it activate the camera to record. When the second package was delivered, I got a notification but by the time Ring was finally able to connect (I got a message that it was having trouble connecting, I tried again and it did finally connect.) I could see the additional packages on the doorstep but by the time the camera activated to record, the delivery person had already dropped off the package and left. It will record if someone rings the bell and stands there long enough for the camera to start recording but that really defeats the purpose of why I purchased this product. I want to make sure I get a recording if someone is stealing packages not just dropping them off. The video is also very choppy and grainy. It's a wifi doorbell and I was concerned with the range to my router might be a concern, so I called the manufacturer and explained the issue. They said if could be a problem and told me I might need a wifi extender. Well, it turns out that they happen to sell those also. So I bought the Ring Chime Pro and wifi Extender on May 31 2017 hoping that would solve the problem. So, I've had the Ring Doorbell operating through the Ring wifi Extender for over a year now as well. It's still awful quality and doesn't capture anyone coming to my door about 90% of the time. It's a lot of money for something that doesn't function as described. The description says you get instant alerts when visitors press the bell or trigger the sensor. The alerts have not once been instant for me. It says Crystal clear HD video. I get grainy and choppy on all of my devices at best. 1 star is much more than this product deserves.\",\n",
       " 'When it works, it works well. However, the unit seems to drop off line frequently. We\\'ve got high speed internet of a good, reliable quality and this device seems to be the only one that routinely drops off line. It is hard wired into power and only about 15 feet from the router. Would be really nice if the phone app had a way to plot online/offline time so you could see how often and how long the device was \"lost\".Currently working with Ring support who is responsive and helpful. If they can figure out what\\'s going on, I\\'ll update this post.UPDATE - Got this escalated to Level 2 and they punched a hole in the firewall to try to help the unit stay online. I also removed the device from my Apple iPhone as the master. It seemed to have more troubles than the wife\\'s Android phone. But, now Ring can\\'t seem to get the account straightened out. I constantly get messages that my account is not valid. Worked with Ring to try to resolve this, but it still isn\\'t very consistent.The product doesn\\'t seem all that stable or reliable but the support team has been helpful. For this reason, they get a second star, but I wouldn\\'t purchase another one.UPDATE 11/28/2017 - I must be one of the unlucky few. This thing doesn\\'t work very well at all for us. Support has tried to help, but it doesn\\'t seem to help. I get a lot of video of people\\'s backsides as they walk away from the door. Sometimes it just freezes during video playback/capture. The most improvement we got was when I installed the Ring App on a computer that never leaves the house. This seems to mostly keep the doorbell connected to the network. When the App was installed on our two roving phones, it would disconnect pretty regularly.UPDATE 12/32/2017 - It got \"cold\" in the south (down into the teens and 20\\'s) and this thing started reporting a low battery. It\\'s hardwired into power!! Must be some kind of problem with the rechargeable battery pack or something. Brought it inside to charge manually and will see what happens next.I won\\'t ever buy one again and you shouldn\\'t waste your money buying one either!',\n",
       " 'Nowhere did it say there was a monthly fee for video playback and storage. Not until I downloaded the app did it say there was only a 30 day free trial period, when I had to pay $4.00 a month to receive what was advertised. Also, the camera quality is so poor, I doubt it would be very useful for facial recognition. Contrast lighting from the sun, along with shade on the porch, makes it difficult see much at all on a sunny day. If you have a weak Wi-Fi signal outside, it may not work at all. I’m glad I tested it before I drillled mounting holes in my wall. The tech support was easy to get hold of, but not very helpful. I had no problem returning it through Amazon.',\n",
       " 'It is a crap shoot on whether a Ring Doorbell will work for you or not. In my case, some videos were good, some lagged, and some were a blacked out screen. Called Ring Help and I was told I need a router upgrade. Problem with that is, my router is the most current version available from Verizon. Seemed weird Ring said it was my router, when it is about 10 feet from the Doorbell and the RSSI reads between between 30 and 60 (Green). So, not sure what the issue is, but with 86.8MB Download Speed, 106.7 Upload Speed, and 32ms Ping Speed, I do not think my router is the issue. I suppose I could try the Ring wi-fi extender; however, I think it will be better to cut my losses now before spending more money. If I stand next to my doorbell with my laptop, my signal strength is max; however, it is too low for reliable ring connection??? Too bad too, it is a great concept that should be fully functional at this point in the Ring lifecycle; however, just look on Ring Help and REDDIT and you will see the Ring Video Doorbell is not 100% ready for prime time use. So, if you are a gambler, go ahead and gamble on whether the doorbell will work for you or not.Update: Received a replacement doorbell from Amazon. Blank recording issue is gone, but I have to say the motion detection on these doorbells is extremely poor. I have my doorbell mounted at 56 inches (recommended is 48 inches) with a 5% wedge to account for the 8 inches, motion detection set to maximum, and videos start recording when I am about three to five feet from the doorbell. Even when my daughter pulls her car in the driveway, still no motion detection. Basically this is a very over priced doorbell at best. I would not recommend this to anyone.',\n",
       " \"Update 6/6/2017Someone pried the button off my doorbell and I had to interact with Ring customer service for the first time.  I'm upgrading them back to 5 stars because I was so impressed with my interaction (unlike Skybell).  I went on chat to see about buying a replacement button.  Zach told me they didn't offer replacement buttons, but would be happy to replace the whole unit for me.  A few minutes later, I had an order confirmation and a new unit on the way.  I'm impressed by how easy it was to contact them, and how responsive they were.  On top of that, I'm pretty sure a break-in to my neighbour's house was averted when a suspicious person came to look through her windows last night and she confront him through her Ring.Update 6/1/2016Finally got live view on my own Ring now.  Other members of my household got it a few weeks earlier than I did so they don't seem to roll it out by household but rather by individual account.Update 3/31/206Although my Ring has the latest firmware update (1.6.76), I still don't seem to have live view on my app.  According to the Ring support site this feature is being steadily rolled out and users will receive an email when their device has been enabled.  My neighbour's Ring has already been activated so I added a screenshot of what your Ring should look like with live view as an option.  Note : According to the support page on Live View, you will only have this feature on the regular Ring if you are connected to doorbell wiring for power.Update 3/23/2016You might want to wait to get the new Ring Pro depending on your needs.  They just announced that they are accepting preorders for availability within the next couple of months (not available to preorder on Amazon yet.)  The new Pro version requires wired doorbell power while this current version allows battery.  The Pro version is 1080P instead of 720P and supposedly has better options around motion detection and night vision.  I'm curious to see if the Pro version will resolve some of the issues I've seen (and some of the criticisms other reviewers have) of the delay between a motion alert or doorbell ring and getting the alert on your phone.In my previous update 3/19/2016 I erroneously stated that only Ring Pro will have live view.  As Joe pointed out in the comments, Live View should be available as a firmware update for existing Ring devices.  My device did not yet update so I cannot test this feature, but once mine does I will check it out and update this review again!-------I bought the Skybell first because I hadn’t heard of Ring.  Due to a manufacturing issue where I started seeing the video feed of SOMEONE ELSE’S front door instead of mine, I got a Ring instead.  I'm actually glad it happened because I prefer the Ring so much more to Skybell, despite some of the limitations.Having had a chance to install both on my door, here are my impressions:***Installation***Skybell comes with the bell, a mounting plate, and some instructions.  Screws were standard and installation was relatively straightforward.  Getting the doorbell to connect to our network was a PAIN.  It wasn’t able to connect via a 5G network plus it didn’t have strong enough signal strength so we had to get a second router for and set up a whole separate network for Skybell.Ring’s package impressed the heck out of me.  You get a little tool pouch with all the tools you need to set up the Ring, including a screw driver, drill bit, self level and more.  If you are screwing into stucco (as I was), I don’t recommend you use the included drill bit.  The hole it drilled was a little large and I had to silicone caulk the hole afterwards to give the screws enough grip.  Ring connected to our network pretty seamlessly and didn’t need to have a separate network nor require the 2nd router.***Size***Ring is MUCH larger than Skybell.  I wish it was thinner but I understand there’s a lot to cram in.  The Ring does stick out quite a bit visually on my wall, but worth it for what I get.  See attached photo to see the size difference.Skybell: 2.15cm / 0.8in thick, 7.1cm / 2.8in diameterRing : 0.87in thick, 4.98 tall by  x 2.43 inches wide***Battery / Power to the device***Skybell is fairly low powered, so there is no battery attached to it.  It runs off the power from your doorbell so it cannot be mounted anywhere you do not have direct power.Ring is battery powered.  I charged it to about 60% via a USB cord first before I plugged it into the wall.  You can get some trickle power from the doorbell, but depending on the weather and use, you may find you drain the battery faster than it charges.  An hour after the bell has been plugged and with one test video call in I was at 57% battery.  Three days later it charged to 77%.  This might get annoying, but it does mean Ring can be mounted anywhere, not just where you have direct power.***Mobile App***Skybell only lets you have one user at a time.  If you want more than one person to have access to the video stream you have to share accounts.  I do like that you can see your doorbell on demand.  I like being able to check in on my door.  I understand that Ring is working on this but it’s not yet available.Ring lets you have multiple users.  The first installed user just has to send email invites to the other users.  Ring shows you recent activity, but you need to pay a $3 a month subscription to see your videos on cloud.  I wish that wasn’t the case but $3 isn’t that bad.  I imagine I will upgrade for the cloud storage long term.In terms of use of app, the Ring interface was relatively straightforward to use and understand.  I like being able to set the active zones for tracking motion so that you don't get too many false alarms.***Video on demand**Skybell : yes, but I saw another person's front door too.Ring : not yet, coming soon***Motion detection:***Skybell : YesRing: Yes***Video quality***I couldn’t find the specs on the Skybell.  Ring seemed to have slightly higher video quality in the day and slightly higher audio quality but this may be subjective.Please note : If you are expecting the quality that you get on your web cam or Facetime on an iPhone the quality will NOT be comparable. This is still early technology so the voice quality and video quality will be a bit crude.  I suspect the design team had to make some trade-offs between video quality and ability to power the unit via battery / trickle charge from the doorbell electrical wire.  That said, I am able to identify the voices and recognize people in the camera so that for me is sufficient though of course I hope that future generations will continue to improve in this respect.  Ring's cloud recording page gives you a pretty accurate idea of what your videos would look like.***Lag / Delay between door bell ring and phone notification***Seems to be about the same on both.  There is a bit of a delay, but for me that’s acceptable compared to the alternative of just missing the door altogether.***Customer Service***Haven't had to interact with Ring's customer service, but Skybell's was so horrid I'm still upset about the interaction.  Skybell wanted me to ship my defective Skybell to them at my expense when it was broadcasting someone else's video stream instead of mine right from the start.  I get that it's expensive for them, but it's NOT a way to win a customer.UPDATE : I actually did have to interact with Ring customer service and they impressed me greatly.  My doorbell button was probably tampered with and they issued an exchange, no questions asked within minutes of contact.Overall, between Skybell and Ring, Ring wins for me hands down.\",\n",
       " \"Update 10/05/17: Customer service's promise was never honored, the labeled box for returning this item never arrived. These products have no warranty, as seen in the other reviews, once you buy this unit you're on your own, no return policy, they would only offer to replace your new device with a used one... This device only worked for a few weeks, just enough to clear the short amazon.com money back deadline and then it stops working. This product has been a scam in our experience, buyers be cautious. Update 9/19/17: Customer service has been outstanding, we had to cancel our subscription and returned the device because we were exhausted from continuously reconnecting it, restarting, and buying more components to make it work. I would point out that customer service was very polite, local english speaking, and very supportive.We give this company 2 stars on the product but 5 stars for customer support, Gabriel from customer service was very supportive and we plan on buying these products in the future when it becomes more reliable. Update 9/18/2017: it's been about two months from the date of purchase and this device has already died... it worked on and off when it was hardwired to the doorbell's 16V line, it only staied connected continuously for about two weeks and we had to keep reconnecting to the router that is only 12 feet away... We're done with it. We're cancelling our subscription and returning everything we bought for this thing. We had purchased the Ring Chime decice hoping that it would work better with that speaker, but no luck.the other day it got stuck emitting a hight pitch noise and had enought time to record it on video, will post it as soon as we figure out how to upload videos to the reviews. We are just too tired of hoping for this unit to work reliably.The presentation is great, it also comes with its own tools for installation, but the functionality is disappointing; it has potential but doesn't work very well quite yet.The volume on the phone app is so low no one can hear it... there are no settings for tones, you are stuck with the factory sound. The notifications only work half of the time and all it does is send a visual note that looks like a text, no sound, sometimes it barely vibrates for a microsecond, but that's it. It doesn't provide enough sound or vibration to notice that someone has pushed the bell button.The video quality is great, the video recording service is very good, the field of view of the camera is perfect, the liveview option is hard to find in the app (as there are two fields with the same title) but it does work great once you find out how to access it.Long story short, it is a good idea but we never know when someone is ringing the doorbell... we learn about it after the fact when we happen to look at our phones.\",\n",
       " \"I bought the Ring when it was on sale for Black Friday. First I had trouble setting up the device through the app. The app kept freezing up during the setup. Contacted Ring support on Twitter and didn't get a reply. Deleted the app and reinstalled. Finally the app worked. This does not come with an inside ringer so that is an extra $30 if you want that. But if your existing doorbell wires are powered, then it will ring that doorbell when you push the button on the Ring.The field of view on the original Ring is good. It's a very wide FOV so it can see a person even if the doorbell is away from the door. It has good sensitivity to movement so anyone coming up to the door will alert you.Here is the problem with the Ring. You MUST pay for the monthly subscription in order to record anything. If you do not pay for the subscription after the first 30 days, then it is just a video doorbell. It will not record anything. So you pay $99 for a doorbell button and then have to pay a subscription forever in order to use it as advertised.If you have an Amazon Fire HD tablet, forget about using it with the Ring. Ring is supposed to be partnered with Amazon and is supported on their devices. Well, it's NOT supported on a Fire tablet. There's not an app from Ring available for it. There's some other people who have made apps that you can buy for like $7, but nothing from Ring.If you want to pay the subscription to Ring forever, then get the Ring. If you want to skip the subscription, then go for something like the Arlo Cameras that offer free Cloud video storage and keep your existing doorbell button.Edit: You can connect the Fire HD to the Ring through the Amazon settings. The problem is it takes too long to open it up and see who is there and you can not talk to the person at the door.I found a way to load Google Play store on the Fire HD and then load the Ring app that way.\",\n",
       " \"My wife and I bought our home in 2015. At the time, this model Ring Doorbell was the only one on the market that did not require a hardwire doorbell behind it to function. Ring's technology has proven reliable and we are pleased with both the performance and the pricing model of their cloud recording service. (Most other services charge per device; Ring's fee structure makes owning multiple cameras more economical) Because of this, we are loyal customers and use their doorbells and security cameras to keep an eye on our property.All this being said, unless your intent is to hardwire this particular doorbell, I strongly recommend the Ring Doorbell 2 over this model. The newer Ring Doorbell 2 has a better camera, but the real closer is THE BATTERY. The original Ring doorbell's battery is NOT USER SERVICEABLE. When it wears out, it's done. You know how your smartphone battery holds less and less charge as it ages to the point where you're constantly recharging it? The only way to fix it is to buy a new smartphone or pay a service to replace the battery. RING DOES NOT OFFER A BATTERY REPLACEMENT SERVICE. I've searched online trying to find the specific battery they use so I can swap it myself, but I can't find it. I've called Ring support about this problem and was told that once the unit is out of warranty, they won't do anything to support the device. I actually added their solar charger to extend my battery life. This was marginally effective, but my battery was already quite worn by then so it wasn't very helpful. I'm now at the point where my doorbell will simply not hold ANY charge. My options at this point are:1. Run a hardwire with a power adapter2. Buy another Ring doorbellIf I had known that I'd have to replace the unit after only four years, I'm sure I would have waited for the second generation unit. Or perhaps buy the original doorbell, but make the effort to run a hardline. With the exception of the battery, this is a fine product and I happily recommend Ring's doorbells and security cameras.A few other notes to consider before you purchase any Ring doorbell: - If you have a hardwire doorbell you plan to use in conjunction with your Ring doorbell, do some research. Some older doorbell systems do not provide the necessary voltage to power Ring's doorbells, which is why you see some negative reviews of this product. You may need some additional parts to step up the voltage to properly power your Ring (or any other brand) doorbell.- A strong, long range WiFi network is required for a reliable video connection. If you have a large home, you should have multiple access points or a mesh network like Eero or Google WiFi to be sure your doorbell can reliably reach the Internet. These use the 802.11ac standard, which is backward compatible with 802.11n devices. (Ring's current line uses Wireless N) If you're not network savvy, Ring's Chime Pro has a network extension feature to make sure the doorbell has a strong WiFi connection.I hope you found this helpful.\",\n",
       " 'It did come and had a scratch on the camera lens, it was so very easy to exchange, just boxed it back up, wrote to seller, that night, it already had another one coming! Very fast, easy service. We were able to see what it looked like on our phone, minus the blurred out faces due to the scratch, it was not crystal clear, but I think you can do somethings to make the video clearer. I will update this after we get the new one up and running. Just wanted to let people know that if you have a problem, the people are very nice, and is sovery easy to return! Thanks! When we get the new one up, if I can get it crystal clear on video, I will give 5 Star! Plus, it was so very easy to install! I normally can’t hook things up lol, but this was much easier then I thought! This will help me out so much, I can’t get out of bed much, and I will never open door if I don’t know a person, this way I can see who is at the door without getting up, trying to peak lol, and I still don’t have to talk to them lol, but now can see who it is. I also bought the chime.UPDATE: Dec. 1, 2017 I did get a new Ring due to the first one had a scratch in the lens. I charged the new one, it lasted 1 week!

       " 'I really wanted to like this better--it offered the features I wanted, especially motion detection, for a price I was willing to pay.And I don\\'t mind a $3. a month charge for video cloud storage, it would be worth it for peace of mind if something like a break in were to happen.First, the good:1) The picture and video are excellent--nice detailed panoramic view from the doorbell\\'s prospective.2) Night vision is excellent too, great picture quality in the blackest of night.3) Great price for the features, now that it sells for under $100.Ok, now the bad, and for me it\\'s a deal breaker:1) There is no \"on/off\" app or button.  So if you are in and out of the house much, or have kids, or any other commotion in front of the doorbell, the motion detector will be CONSTANTLY be in use. Sure, you can use an app to silence any alerts to motion.  But that\\'s not going to stop the doorbell from recording that motion.2) Because of not being able to turn it off and the constant use, your doorbell will completely discharge it\\'s internal battery within 2 days time, and it will NOT matter whether doorbell is hardwired or not.  In fact, it will discharge even sooner if on battery alone.  And a discharged battery will not recover on it\\'s on just by being hardwired (ex, it took the hard wiring 3 days of recharging to recover 20% of it\\'s charge).3) Customer service is not.  You will wait forever and not talk to anyone, and they will not call you back.  Best to hit a button for something like ordering, only then will you get a person on the other end that can tell you \"we\\'re working on an app to turn it on and off.\"Here\\'s the solution for turning the motion on and off.  It\\'s the only reason it hasn\\'t been returned (yet).You have to reduce the motion fields to zero, then push the doorbell button to set. It works most of the time.What a hassle!Missing an on/off app clearly means it\\'s still not ready for prime time.  And its been out for 2 years!UPDATE:It stopped working altogether 3 months after use.  Ring is sending a replacement, 1 year warranty.

A bit about me; I have 24 years experience in the commercial security industry. I design and engineer systems, I thought this would be a simple and easy resolution, I was wrong! Biggest complaint, I run a Galaxy 8, all updates are current, and a motion alarm comes in and I can\\'t view it! I have to close the app, re-open, and by that time it becomes utterly useless.

       " 'Horrible cold weather performance...Ring tech support suggestions are worthless.  Even hardwired into house performance under 40 degrees F is spotty if at all.  If you live in a cold climate avoid, product is utterly useless until Spring.  Ring needs to address the issue that the internal battery design even when on house charge is faulty in cold weather. Highly disappointedUpdate 11/28: was contacted by Ring support last week after they saw this negative review. I explained the issue I was having and that it continued to be an issue. It was suggested that I upgrade to the Pro model of the doorbell which doesn’t have an internal battery. I suggested an exchange as i wasnt about to spend another $200+ to replace a falsely advertised Doorbell 2 I had purchased to begin with.  I simply received another generic email from tech support asking how things were going, no response to my exchange idea.  If I could give Ring 0 stars I would for a falsely advertised(operating temperatures), worthless product.Update 1/07/18:Still not working...tech support continues to tell me to lower the motion sense which I have to almost 5ft. Still nothing works. Temperatures are below 20 degrees at this time, still within the working specs as Ring claims, but the unit doesn’t work. No suggestion of replacement with any upgraded unit, but that’s probably because they don’t work in the cold weather as claimed either.',\n",

When someone approaches the front door they can walk up and leave an item.....or take the item and all I see is the  persons back as they leave. I have tried various settings and combinations of settings with the same dismal outcome.Next if you do happen to have someone actually ring the doorbell and you are able to open the app in time to speak to the person at the door, the volume is so low the person has lean down to within a foot of the doorbell to hear my voice.I have also noticed that people are onto the look and sound of the Ring doorbell and they have a tendency to knock on the door rather than ring the doorbell. This was not the case when I had the old school doorbell button.Finally, in order to view a saved file you must subscribe to their service which is $3 a month or $30 a year.

       " \"I've had Ring for 3 months now, and my final tl;dr analysis... Ring is not yet ready for prime time.The good:1.  Very solidly built.  It feels high quality2.  Install is straightforward, and mounting and unmounting is mostly painless (more on that in the cons)3.  Video quality is top notch with a wide field of view4.  Interface to adjust sensitivity is intuitive5.  Warranty if stolen is a good value, especially since its not permanently mounted, and can be removed with a simple tool.The bad:1.  Ring is slow.. really slow.  I have a very good home network, and WiFi signal near the doorbell is 4/5.  So the issue is the Ring's responsiveness.  Other reviews note, this is a problem,2.  Ties to #1, many videos are of people walking away after ringing the doorbell (deliveries etc).  It appears Ring takes at least 10 seconds to engage the camera and ring the bell.3.  I also bought the Ring Chime, and this is also affected by the Ring's lag.4.  When the Ring activates on your phone, unless you have it in your hand, and activate it quickly, you are locked out of it.  You can not activate the camera to see who's standing there.  so add this to the lag, and you may have people standing at your door for a min before in the end, you need to open the door to see who's there.5.  It's 2015, how does Ring not have more than one chime sound??6.  No PC access to videos7.  Deleting old videos are a bit of a chore, especially if you have lots of activations8.  Big one here for those who don't have power to the doorbell, the charge for the doorbell, even with low sensitivity, charge only lasts at best, 30 days.  So you need to unmount, charge and remount every time.9.  Tied to number 8, if your Ring discharges completely, you need to go through the entire setup for the Ring again.  And this means, deleting the item from the interface and re-adding it.  A bit of a tedious process considering the MAC address, wifi setup etc, all remain the same.  Again issues you should not see on a 200$ doorbell.I'll update as I use it more.. but simply for an item that does 1 thing, it doesn't do it well.  This maybe a simple patch at some future date which will correct the lag issues, but until that's resolved, you will have a rough go of it.\",\n",
       " 'Finally ordered and installed the Ring Doorbell.  Installed it as a hard wire over our existing doorbell hard wired placement.  Very easy to install although had some slight adjustments to make on the back plating to ensure that it was \"straight\" to snap in the cover.  After I was able to adjust everything, locking the cover in place with the screws was easy.  Suggest installing the app before physically installing the unit as there are a couple of videos on the app that will give you some guidance on how to do the physical installation.  I assigned the app to provide notifications to multiple people in the house and everything works great.  Motion detection was a little tricky as I needed to adjust for detection distance.  Only small issues we\\'ve had were some slight delays in notifications when ringing the doorbell on occasion which was probably due to internet or server congestion.  The infrared detection is very reliable as we also have a security camera on the Ring Doorbell also and I feel that the motion detection is a little better on Ring than my camera!  After about 2 weeks, we are very pleased about the Ring Doorbell performance.  Highly recommend as an addition to your \"smart home\".',\n",

Prepare for it to last much much much shorter than their stated battery life. I was lucky to get two weeks before it would die without warning.2. The motion sensitivity is obtuse to configure and ultimately useless. When I needed it most, to record a package theft, it simply didn't record. I have a recording from before the theft and afterwards, but nothing showing the actual theft.3. It only records for 30 seconds. If the thief loiters for 30 seconds, then approaches and steals, guess what, that won't be recorded.4. There is no way to actually cancel a paid plan from the iOS app. You can signup for it there, but you need to login to their web app to cancel. It didn't even occur to me that they would have a web app, because the entire experience was through the iOS app. It took me a month to realize this, because they have no public documentation of how to cancel their plans.\",\n",
       " 'I have had my Ring Video Doorbell since the beginning of June and to this day have not got it to work as advertised. I contacted support numerous times, each time they had a different excuse as to why it wasn\\'t working correctly, and each time provided a \"fix\" which did not work. I also had the device exchanged through Amazon, and the problems still persisted. The app which provides the settings for the doorbell has settings to adjust the areas of motion which are detected, frequency of alerts etc. Still I get only two results... it detects EVERYTHING (even motion which is not there) regardless of settings resulting in false alerts from sunrise to sunset OR it detects only motion within five feet or less of the doorbell. Either way completely defeats the purpose of having purchased it to begin with. There is also the issue of the first few seconds of video being completely whited out, which half the time results in the videos being completely useless. Mind you the video starts recording with a delay as well. I should also mention that even with it being minimally functional, the battery life is nowhere near as long as advertised and it takes almost an entire day to fully charge it.Overall I would not recommend this device to anyone as it is nothing more than an overpriced doorbell that needs to be charged every two months. I am sure they could come out with a firmware update to address many of the issues, however, they instead came out with a new doorbell with these fixes and priced it at twice the cost. If I could have rated it with zero stars I would have because that is what the device deserves.AUGUST 2019 UPDATE - Never did get the device working as advertised and that\\'s with buying every accessory under the sun! I initially contacted Ring support at least 15 times and they ran me in circles until I couldn\\'t return it. The best I\\'ve gotten it to work is now, where it only detects motion within six feet and defeats the purpose of having it. I can\\'t extend the range ANY because if I do I get nonstop motion alerts. Ring support said it\\'s due to traffic 90+ feet away when it\\'s only supposed to have a range of 30 feet. I recently got a new router and needed to take the doorbell down to hit the Setup button they stupidly place on the back. But the $0.99 screwdriver made for the device snapped off. Finally got them to send a replacement screwdriver, after trying to get me to buy a whole new doorbell, and I got the screwdriver today. First time I tried to unscrew a screw it twisted the screwdriver into a corkscrew and the tip broke off inside the screw. Ring support said I\\'ll have to \"remove it with force\" but because it\\'s no longer under warranty, they will give me a code to buy another useless doorbell at a discount to replace it.DO NOT BUY IT!

Here is where the problems started, someone at Ring decided to charge my credit card to get all my devices on the \"Same renewal schedule\" without my permission, I did not want them on the same schedule but Ring took it upon themselves to charge my credit card to pro rate all 3 devices, told them to refund the money they took without my permission and put the devices back on the schedule they were on.....talk about stupid customer service....cant do it 4 people cant do it well you took money you were not authorized to take, refunded my money put me on a trial cut one of my devices short on the year by 2 months wont fix that...

Purchased before Christmas based on good price and good reviews on Amazon. Just opened it this week and what a disappointment.  It is a disappointment in and of itself, but when I compare it to the ease of use and reliable performance of Arlo devices, and it falls even more miserably short. The microphone  would never activate allowing two-way communication. The motion detection was unreliable. Alerts for motion detection we're also unreliable.  I knew there might be a problem when I went to the App Store to download the Ring app and saw the bad reviews. Not sure where all of the high ratings come from on the Amazon site.  This is the first product I have purchased on Amazon where the reviews and the performance have not matched.\",\n",

I also bought the chime, and you can set it to any volume as well as going off only for rings or motion. I did keep the default settings to 5' rather than extending the zone. If you increase the zone, it will pick up traffic driving by.

It should be grey if offline. * It should tell me information about offline events (last network and power loss etc). * Too little detail in error messages and includes incorrect information (saying it cannot connect when it can but isn\\'t happy with upload speed) * Too little diagnostic information, should me much more self checking and error handling, this can only help Ring\\'s reputation and customer satisfaction and downtime. * No timestamp on recorded video, should be an option. * Current Firmware levels are secret / undocumented, as is any associated change history. Should be in health page as well as indication as to whether this is the current (at least generally available firmware, don\\'t points for a button that allows me to request getting on a pilot release after checking what has been fixed). * It forces the video to landscape, it should be my option to rotate, either this or it would be better to have a force landscape option for when not viewing video. * I\\'d prefer an option to control how long the controls are visible on screen, its way to short now, but I\\'d rather they stayed up or down until I changed my mind and closed them. * I should be able to see all the statistical stuff (voltage, last seen etc).you capture in the app and online. * I should be linking users/zones in exactly the way I link chimes, I had to send 3 or 4 sets of invites. * The PRO needs a rechargeable battery to survive power outages.  This should be charged during the day to avoid causing hum in mechanical chimes at night after the infra red LEDs come on and to better handle different power supplies. * When I use \"Live View\" or the software wants to show me video: *  * It frequently fails with the incorrect message \"cannot connect\", this takes ages. It was showing me garbage on the screen rather than diagnostic or progress information of some type  * It sometimes eventually gets to showing me a black video but I have audio  * None of the above is acceptable for a security product or doorbell for that matter:  *  * The video / audio view should immediately open so that under all circumstances (where a motion or doorbell alert occurred proving network exists) I can at least talk to whoever is there.  * The doorbell could be doing its own speedtest and/or other determination to work out its current capabilities and:  *  * If it can\\'t support 1080p then it should either reduce the framerate or fall back to 720p  * If it can\\'t support 720p then it should either reduce the framerate further or fall back below 720p  * If video not possible it should be capturing and transmitting images at whatever framerate it can support.  * It should be showing progress + diagnostic information while this is happening.  This diagnostic information needs to go into \"health\" page. * Alerts: *  * Both motion and ring should have sleep period options so I can decide that at a certain time of night to ignore motion and/or ring, so I can sleep uninterrupted. * Motion alerts: *  * Seem to be completely turned off/on by the setting in the Ring App, so turning it off on phone turns it off for the ring website and I assume for all other users, I should be turning them off for my phone only and they should go to website and any users that want it.  * I should be able to set my own ringtone for motion with at LEAST the option of matching this to that chosen for Ring Chimes but preferably any Android notification tone (including \"silent\").  * It would be nice to be able to pause alerts when you know there will be activity (for a period of configurable times, 10 minutes, 1 hour etc) * The physical Ring Chime: *  * I should be able to set any ringtone that is available in whatever format that it supports  * I should be able to match this with the application if I wish (that should probably be the default). * Renaming and re-adding Ring PRO chimes: *  * Should never be required or requested  * Sound not be required after power outage. Data should be restored from phone/cloud when device reconnects.  * If required should not remove:  *  * Zone information  * Alert Settings  * User invites / shares  * Anything really * Pressing the reset button on the PRO should not be requested (its hard to do) or if so it should be possible from the app and in any case in most cases is only used due to insufficient diagnostic information being captured and displayed. * Motion & Ring History *  * Some history on the web site should be available for free (for example a week or 2 days, whatever).  * I should be able to add notes to history activities  * If video wasn\\'t captured or other issues detected, it should say this and not require me to go into each in turn only to find it it was a failure.  * I should be able to choose from a calendar, can\\'t even imagine scrolling through 6 months of data.... * Ring Web Site / FAQ *  * Any page discussing the standard or PRO (or in future other) doorbells should clear show which products the page applies (and doesn\\'t apply).  * I got a lot of good information from support staff (like the \"softer reset option\"), while its great they can provide it to me that information should be in the FAQ  * * Physical installation. *  * Most decent devices have have slots and not holes where you\\'d be able to rotate and level the device even with drill holes misaligned, the PRO doesn\\'t do this (it has small holes) * The drill bit that came in the box was dead in 10 seconds (a couple of mils deep) I used my own bit after that but the bit moves when drilling (I think my bricks are harder than most)',\n",

       " \"I cautiously bought this product after reading numerous reviews about the products failure, and well, now I feel obligated to share my own poor experience with the Ring Doorbell.  The one plus is that it is very easy to install.  I had my old doorbell off and this one screwed in and running in about 15 minutes.  Everything started off great!  I was receiving a notification when someone was at my door and the doorbell would ring my mechanical chime when pushed.  Then reality set in..  After owning this product for 4 days (not exaggerating), the product seemed to go 180 degrees from where it started.  Now when someone comes to my door and pushes the doorbell, it doesn't ring!  YAY!! It's not like that's what this product is designed to do??  Not only does it not ring my home chime anymore, I don't receive notifications that the doorbell button was even pushed.  The only notifications I receive are when my neighbors drive down the street (not why I bought this product, although I know some people buy it for this).  I have done troubleshoot after troubleshoot and it simply doesn't work.  I was overcome with joy to put my boring old doorbell back on the wall and hear it work when the button is pushed.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this doorbell.\",\n",
       " \"Pros: I live in a relatively high-crime neighborhood, and I have peace of mind knowing who is at the door when the doorbell rings. Being able to talk to someone without actually opening the door to them is huge for me. The greatest benefit for me is actually the Ring app itself. The neighbor alerts function is really helpful. For example, about 5 different people in my neighborhood have posted videos in the last week of people casing their houses. If I didn't have this app, I would have no idea this was going on. It's scary, but at least now I know to be vigilant. You also receive reports on robberies, shootings, and fires so you know to avoid the area.Cons: The motion alerts are useless if you live on a busy street. I have the radius set to 5 feet from the doorbell and I get alerts at least every 20 minutes all day long. When I check the video, no one is there. It's just a car or bus passing. I can't believe the sensor can't tell the difference between something moving 5 feet from the door and something out on the street 20 feet away. I wound up turning the motion alerts off because it's such a nuisance, but now what happens if someone is casing my house? I'm only alerted if someone actually rings the doorbell, which people with ill intent won't do. The doorbell function also randomly stops working if the app needs to be updated or if the app decides to randomly log you out of your account. As others have mentioned, if you miss a ring and the person is still there or if there's a motion in progress, you can't see the video unless you have the live video function enabled, which eats away at your battery life. You have to wait for the person to walk away before you can see who it was.This product is such a great idea in theory, but it needs some serious tweaking in order to provide effective home security.\",\n",
       " 'I ordered this during Black Friday week and got it at a discounted price.  I used it to replace a competitive video doorbell from a security company.  The biggest weakness of the security company doorbell was the lack of a Wi-Fi chime and the cost to upload video clips per month.  Therefore, I also picked up the Ring Chime to help provide some additional coverage space for the notification.The product was easy to unpack.  I like the fact that screws, a screw driver, and a USB cable were provided for recharging.  I do recommend a pair of wire-strippers for wired doorbells - the leads on my doorbell were very short and were not long enough to wrap around the screw posts.  If you are replacing a wired doorbell, the AC voltage provided by your doorbell transformer seems to \"trickle charge\" the built-in battery.  I couldn\\'t find any specifications on how long the internal battery will last - which makes me wonder if a doorbell replacement will be necessary even with hardwired power at some point in the future.For those of you with wired doorbells, I do recommend initially charging the doorbell first to 100% before you install it. The trickle charge is just that - don’t expect the wired doorbell transformer to charge it to 100% for you. It might - it’ll just take a long time.Setup is incredibly simple and requires a smartphone.  It seriously took longer to wire and install than it did to program the doorbell module.  The built-in videos within the Ring app were easy to follow and did not require much prior research to get started.The Ring Chime was also incredibly simple to configure and get connected to the doorbell.  For those of you on the fence wondering if the chime is worth it - it absolutely is for larger homes. Our mechanical chime is not loud enough to hear throughout our home, and digital wired chimes cost more than Ring’s adapter.  There are a number of built-in chimes you can choose from.  I didn\\'t see any method of adding your own, or Ring having the ability to download some from their website.The install was not a perfect experience on my part though, but was pretty darn close.  Here are the two things that I ran into that might help some of you.First, my mailbox was located near where the doorbell has been typically placed.  It was a Wi-Fi shield even though my router is a room away behind the door along the same outer wall.  While the Ring app stated that my Wi-Fi was \"OK\", it was choppy enough that I had issues connecting to the doorbell and getting good picture quality.  I moved my mailbox and the signal dramatically improved - video quality and connection are instantaneous now.  Don’t accept OK for your Wi-Fi connection.  It needs to be “Good” or better for a pleasant experience.Second, my FiOS router had the 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi channel set to a static channel assignment.  Ring did not like this for some reason even though I have a solid, symmetrical 100Mb connection (up and down) and this was after the mailbox experience ;-).  I could not get notifications on my device or to the Ring Chime module.  I had to set the channel assignment to auto, and got everything working perfectly.All in all, it was well worth the money.  However, I ended up returning it.  In my housing plan, EVERYONE has a wireless router with 2.4ghz turned on. There was way too much congestion to have the Ring keep a good solid signal  Given no 5ghz WiFi is supported with this specific model, I returned it and exchanged it for a Ring Doorbell Pro model.For those of you not in crowded neighborhoods, this may work well for you. However, technophiles should go with the ‘Pro’ model.',\n",
       " \"I have only had this for about a week, but it has been a terrible experience thus far.1) The app cannot setup the doorbell on my Pixel XL running Android Pie. I can connect to it's ad hoc network all day long, but the app never successfully talks to the doorbell.  Looking through their support they had some possible settings that would cause this, but they were specific to Samsung phones and did not apply to mine. I have had no problem setting up many other devices that use the same system of creating an ad hoc network without issue. This is the only one which has not worked.2) Even though my access point (Ubiquiti AC Pro) is less than 20 feet from the doorbell and only through one outside wall, it still has terrible reception. My old S4, which I had to use to setup it up because of point 1,  has better reception than it. Heck I still pull wifi on my phone at my road which is quite a far distance away compared to the doorbell, which if I am standing next to I can literally see the access point through the front door.3) It takes FOREVER to connect to the live feed making it useless for actually viewing once motion is detected.4) It has no ability to work locally you have to go through their cloud service even if you are on the same wifi network as the device.5) I understand charging for a cloud service to record and I knew going in that was how these work, but it is pretty ridiculous to not have an option to store to an NVR or at least have some sort of output stream. Again, I knew this going in, but I did want to voice that makes the product not nearly as nice.I have $20 POE cameras that offer better features and frankly work a hell of a lot better even though they have a poorly translated buggy web app to manage them. If I hadn't dumbly recycled the packaging that came with it, I would 100% return this. Completely a waste of money thus far.

After trying every possible wiring hookup the support tech said he was escalating the issue to level 2 support.  I was informed that my existing electronic chime is not compatible and they offered to send me a Ring chime free of charge, which I accepted.  Then I attempted to set up the Ring doorbell without hard wiring only to find out that the unit is completely dead and won't accept a charge.  I contacted Ring support and was told by Christian that they would send a replacement unit only to have a followup message from  Eric that the replacement offer was in error and that my existing Heath-Zenith is not compatible.  I replied back that the issue was no longer the compatibility issue but that the Ring doorbell is completely dead.  On 2/14 I received a message from Chris A that they were processing an order for a replacement unit and would send tracking information within 2-3 days if not sooner.

Shortly after this purchase a representative at ring saw my review and contacted me. She was great! Within minutes I had a credit in the form of a PayPal payment for the full retail price of my ring pro, and was told I could keep my original ring!I now join the throngs of customers that rave about ring customer support! I am a totally satisfied customer, and the ring pro is amazing, but that is a review I'll post on the ring pro side. Thank you Ring!Let me start by saying I love the doorbell, and for the most part it functions as it should albeit not ringing a few times and getting phone calls from food delivery places telling me they're standing at the front door.The battery.... Ohhhh the battery. Lasts a couple months one time, then a month another time. Always charging. Called ring and they were not receptive of upgrading me to a pro doorbell. I told them I was now going to run wires to hardwire (which I didn't want to do originally) and told them, had I known I was going to run wires I would have bought the pro version. Again, they were not willing to return and upgrade.There is a reason they came out with ring doorbell 2 with a detachable battery. Even then I'm sure you'll be constantly charging. At least include 2 batteries to swap out instead of it being out of commission while charging.Anyway, that's my story. Maybe I'll try a different brand because I am not giving them more of my money to upgrade to a pro at full retail price.\",\n",
       " \"OK.  I was already having LOTS of false alarms with the Ring Doorbell.  I live in an urban area fairly close to a street and have been getting motion alarms every time a school bus or a larger truck drives by my home.  This was happening no matter how I adjusted the motion sensitivity.  This results in boy calling wolf situation - I ignored the alarms for the most part because the vast majority were false.Conversely, the doorbell does not work well when there actually is a visitor at my home.  Generally visitors aren't picked up until they are walking away from my porch - not much help when you are trying to identify a visitor or a thief. You can see from the pics that my walk up to the house is not directly in front of the door, but the gate and walk are easily visible.  Sometime visitors aren't captured at all.  The ring doorbell captured the meter reader coming into my yard because my brother was on the front porch at the time, however it did record him leaving the yard at all.I was still willing to work with the Ring and was just about to install a wedge to adjust the angle of the device in an effort to decrease the number of false alarms when my 30 day trial of the subscription ended.  I have now found out that I can't view my videos AT ALL except right when the motion is happening.  This morning I got a motion alert - I opened the Ring app to see someone's back walking away from my home.  I thought I knew who it was so I closed the video.  2 seconds later I tried to re-open it to double check and guess what?  I can't do that unless I want to pay a minimum of $30 annually for a subscription.  2 seconds later.  I can understand paying for a subscription to save videos over a period of time - like maybe more than a week or a month.  But 2 seconds later?  That's unreasonable.  Granted $30 annually is not a lot to pay but I'm not going to give them another cent of my money.  The doorbell was barely acceptable at $99 with the free subscription and it certainly is not worth any more than that.\",\n",
       " \"Product initially worked as intended for about a month. Battery went flat after less than 60 days. Product then wouldn't charge. Spoke with company sent out a replacement. (That wasn't easy either... around and around in circles, being asked the same questions until finally over an hour and a half later they decided I needed a replacement.) After leaving the defective unit on charge for 5 days, it finally started charging. Held a charge of around 20%  for about a week. Then the video feed showed just a black screen. answer and talk buttons were still visible, but the feed itself was black. Replacement arrived. Did the initial set up. Refused to connect to my wifi. Went through all the steps, placed it next to the router, (mind you every other item that connects to my wifi was connected and working) still wouldn't connect.  two for two.

       " 'You can read my original review below.  I was not a happy camper.  This is an update as of March 2019..  Alexis from Ring contacted me about my review and offered to personally help and troubleshoot.  Two phone calls with her and lots of attention from her side later.......the long and short of it is that after her working with me for almost a month, sending back the original device and configuring with a new one, I now have an operating system that is not perfect by the standards of my wireless network, but far superior to what it was.  I am going from 2 stars to 4 stars based on that.  5 stars would be my expectations for the hardware, and it can\\'t get there, but 5 stars certainly gets there for Ring support.  Thank you Alexis for your help, and your personal follow up!!Original review:I bought this doorbell to go with their Floodlight Cam, which I ordered elsewhere.  I wanted to replace my existing motion sensitive floodlight and figured I\\'d do the doorbell at the same time with the benefit of video thrown in  The good news?  Both of them work.  The bad news?  Not as advertised.  The wireless reception on both of these devices just plain sucks.  I\\'m an IT person.  I have a high end wi-fi router that blasts 2.4 ghz (with both of these can use) all the way to the other end of my house , and we use everything from Google Home to laptops, to Ipads with it, but this doorbell (and the floodlight) which are both less than 50 feet from the router both complain about poor signal, so the video is \"jerky\" and delayed when someone comes to the door or the driveway.  Nothing at all like the advertisements on TV for real time movement.  I even broke down and ordered a wi-fi repeater on Amazon and plugged it in less than 20 feet from the floodlight and only 4 ft. from the doorbell, and it is still terrible.  The quality of the picture on both the floodlight and this doorbell is fine, but movement is terrible, the Ring app tells me I have wi-fi interference, (I don\\'t)  and all I get from their troubleshooting is to buy a signal booster, which I did and which I don\\'t need anyway.  I give it two stars because the floodlight works fine, but I didn\\'t buy this to have an expensive floodlight and doorbell.  Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn\\'t do it again.',\n",
       " \"Notifies me of every car that drives past the house even though I set it to 5ft radius. Ring's advice: shove something behind the top so it tilts down. Thanks... Often times, when somebody is actually at the house, I can't even open the app to speak to them or see who it is. This is pure garbage... Waste of money. I'll probably just deactivate notifications and just use it as a fancy looking doorbell. Best $200 I ever spent...\",\n",
       " 'This doorbell has MAJOR flaws. I love the idea of it, but hate the execution. I will list the problems I\\'ve discovered in the couple weeks I\\'ve owned it below.1. The motion sensing feature detects \"heat\", not actual motion. It fails miserably as it does not alert to a 4000lb vehicle entering or leaving the driveway(within the manufactures 30ft effective range), but detects a landscaper 100ft away. It will VERY frequently miss people walking up to the door, with no reproducible reason why. Sometimes it will detect, sometimes it won\\'t. Day or night, doesn\\'t matter it will very inconsistently detect motion, many times missing it altogether. Sometimes when someone comes up and rings the doorbell, it literally doesn\\'t record or detect any motion until the doorbell has already been rung. Meaning they were able to walk for 30 feet all the way to my door, passing my cars, passing my garages, passing my courtyard, and still nothing until they\\'ve pushed the doorbell.2. I\\'ve had instances where I\\'ve received alerts, but they didn\\'t save in the cloud recording history. Or when I\\'ve received alerts and I\\'ve attempted to answer them/view the alert on my phone, it wouldn\\'t load the live video of whatever set off my motion or allow me to answer when someone rang the doorbell. Again, like the motion sensing capability, very inconsistent at actually allowing you to receive or answer notifications, or actually storing motion from when the motion first happens. Many times I will try to play a video from a motion alert, only to see a car that was in front of my house leaving, but not the activity of them being there. They really should have it constantly recording and after each motion detection, store 10 seconds before and after to ensure nothing is missed.3. Trying to get a lot of the customer service is rough. You will be on hold for ever. I\\'ve been on hold for 40 mins straight only to be disconnected. Multiple times it\\'s been longer then 30 mins. A call to customer service had me on the phone with a level 1 rep for over an hour to no avail, only to be told that a level 2 rep would have to call me the next day...and days went by and the call never came. I then reached out to customer service again and I found out the reason I never got a call was because it was canceled because the level 2 reps thought it wasn\\'t an issue they needed to resolve, and that level 1 should\\'ve handled it, so instead of having level 1 handle it, they just canceled my ticket. The people I did actually speak to in customer service were excellent.The reason I\\'m giving them a 3 star rating is BECAUSE the Ring Pro is now available, and it is supposed to fix many pitfalls of this version. It isn\\'t a replacement to the Ring, it\\'s a more expensive($250 instead of $199) and better version with 1080p instead of 720, it takes photos every second or so and thats how it detects movement instead of with heat. It should be more accurate. It also has much more adjustability of motion zones. I have a pro on order, and I\\'m looking forward to trying that instead. I love the idea, but the execution is poor on this version. Hopefully the Pro will eliminate these problems and work as intended. Customer service did help me out as much as they could, because it was purchased at Amazon they couldn\\'t accept it as a return but did everything in their power to keep me as a customer, which I really appreciated. I suspect they are going through some \"growing pains\" as they have really expanded quickly in a short time, seems like they are working on improving everything. Overall, It\\'s a must have for every home...IF it works properly! Maybe mine was just a defective item? I hope so, because these 4 holes I drilled into my brand new homes door frame to mount this doorbell aren\\'t going to be in vain!!!!! LOL. The new pro should be here any day now!',\n",
       " 'GOOD: Easy to install.BAD: $100 doorbell; optics are terrible, motion detection is very slow to react missing the approach to the unit, LOTS of false alarms, day and night, can\\'t recommend as a security system.UGLY: Worst customer service I have ever encountered, this from a Company owned by Amazon, customer service based in Ukraine, have tried for weeks to get them to replace unit, they refuse, apparently stalling till the warranty runs out.

       " 'BEST PRODUCT EVERY INVENTED!  This is a VIDEO doorbell that set off by MOTION  and people RINGING your doorbell with intergraded cameras and 2 way audio that is sent immediately to your smartphone (Android or Apple).  So even if you are shopping or at work you can talk to the people over your smart phone and they have no idea if you are in the house or away!I have to tell you about this product because it has been a tremendous help in identifying the person who has been steeling our packages, and has been a blessing for proof that our UPS guy has left my stolen packages on the front patio of our condo, so he doesn\\'t get blammed. Since I order everything possible from Amazon Smiles, I get packages every day. I was searching for a doorbell that would ring on all 3 floors of my condo through wifi when I found this product!  I have Nest Drop Cams in my house to watch my dogs and record if anyone breaks in, hurts my animals or steels anything.  The RING DOORBELL is my #1 defense against people wandering onto my patio and taking my plants and packages, and doing any harm if they were to break in.  Thanks to the RING DOORBELL, I have been able to show the police the videos, and catch the people who are the perpetrators!This is how simple it works...I do not have a wired doorbell, (which you can wire it to), or you can use the battery that comes with it.  I have my RING set to MOTION as well as when someone rings the bell.  I had to drill into concrete for the base.  It was easy because RING gives you the correct size drill bit, along with everything needed for installation.  All you need is a drill.  It literally took me all of 15 minutes to instal the amazing gadget!  The best part is that anyone that would want to steel it, they really have no choice to be caught on video, and it does have a special screw that you would need to remove it from the base.  I do believe that RING offers you a free replacement if it is stolen!I easily set the RING doorbell to notify my husband and I when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell.  There are no problems with adding more than one user in case one of us is busy.  (You can also add-on other cameras around your house.) We get a distinct chime ring on our iPhones instantly and tap the RING App and we can see and have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door!  Sometimes I answer the door from my third floor office, without having to run down to the front door.  With packages that need signatures, this is a huge help since the US postal service never gives me enough time to get down stairs to sign for packages; they are always in a hurry and leave before I can get to the door!It is amazing when someone is on your property, wait until you get their face on camera, and then say, \"Can I help you?\"  We have had people taping flyers on our door, solicitors, and as soon as I say, Can I help you they either try to sell something and I can say, \"No thank you\", or they RUN!  if you pay the $30/ year, which is a lot less than the Drop Cams $9/month, you can go back and review all the videos.  That is how the police were able to catch the guys steeling packages , not just from our patio but our neighbors.There are videos on YouTube on how to instal the RING Doorbell, trouble shooting and more for easy to follow help and you get 30 days free recording so you can decide to pay for the service if you want to keep recordings!.I am going to give these out to my each of my family members for the holidays.  The gift of safety and confidence is priceless!',\n",
       " '1. The images and videos from the camera pointing outside are pix-elated. Camera was replaced one, then customer support assisted in the problem with the next camera, initially blaming the internet connection, but that was not the reason when I moved the router next to the camera inches away. The conclusion was pretty much the camera outside by the front door on a covered porch CAN NOT produce a decent quality image of the person ringing the bell because of the ambient light.-So, if the ambient light is a problem with the video quality, then what? Use the camera inside? It does not make sense.-2.  The fact you have to pay a monthly subscription to have access to the videos, it is outrageous. Why the camera does not have an internal SD card where the owner can check \"offline\" the videos? How much can this add to the price of the camera? The vendor try to drag you on a monthly subscription service to check YOUR videos?  Does not make sense either.-----UPDATE: I wish the rate will have a negative amount of stars. I will give it a minus two (2).After a while I noticed the time between somebody ring the bell and get the notification on the phone LOCALLY is noticeable long. Very. Again, last technology updated router: checked. 3 feet away from the router: check.  65Mbps ISP: checked. And to make it worse I am on the phone waiting for someone to give some information about how to proceed because now my door bell ring does not even ring. So I have to put the old analog switch again.-----UPDATE again, my sons bike was stolen in front of the camera and nothing happened. I just filed a police report regarding my son stolen bike from the porch in front of this $%#$% camera.  Since now the ring camera  is keeping disconnecting from my Wi-Fi all the time, pretty much no notifications are being made over the phone. This is just an expensive bell switch. The only reason I have not remove this and gently fixed with a hammer is because now I need to pay someone to put the original bell switch the way it was.-I truly regret the day I had bough this. Big, BIG waste of time and money now. My honest advice? Get some type of camera that actually works, high resolution, local storage so your videos in your loafers wont hit the internet when another hacking event happen for having your private information in the cloud. - (minus) Five stars now. DO not waste your time and money on this brand.',\n",
       " 'The installation was relatively easy. I used the wiring of the pre-existing doorbell.The ring doorbell works as described. It appears well built and the video is of reasonable quality.However, even with the highspeed internet, it takes at least 10 seconds before I get a notification on the mobile phone. Without wifi, the image on the phone is sometimes blurred.The mobile app is easy to use but lacks enough customization. In addition, it does not allow you to view live from the phone without an event (ring or motion detection).The biggest disappointment is that after paying $ 200 for a doorbell one has to pay additionally $30 annually to be able to view past events.Ring.com does not allow you to link to dropbox or other cloud services and forces you to pay this additional cost.Furthermore, the ring doorbell does not use a secure connection and is vulnerable to potential hacking. The cloud storage also does not provide any explicit guarantees on privacy and security.I will be experimenting for the next couple of weeks and most likely will return for refund.Update: After 2 weeks of work, the doorbell dropped from the wifi connection and would not reconnect. I tried many different ways to reconnect the devise. Support was responsive but their answer was to short-circuit the devise by running a screw driven at the back contact pins. I returned for full refund.',\n",

From what little I know is I think people with a long delay when the ring button is pushed is because they have, 'slow cell phone service'. Video quality is great and the sound is clear. We are old and slow so my wife had to call Customer Support four times on the day I installed it. All four times they answered their phone by the 5th ring. Very friendly and helpful people which is rare now days. Both of our cell phones get 'rung' when the doorbell is pushed. Even while the wife was at work the motion sensor notified someone was at the door, it was me. We had a 10 minute conversation using the Ring doorbell, she could see me but of course I couldn't see her. The sound was very clear. I think it was worth the $200 we paid :) Don't waste your time or money on the 'solar panel' charger. Went through 2 of them and neither one charged. 0 Charging with full sun.\",\n",
       " '02/25/19 Update reduce 5 star to 4 star - What you should knowI do really like this, but some things that push it closer to a 3 star (4 for now) rating.These are very expensive for what you get. They need to come down to below $100 for any component (doorbell, security light camera, stand alone... ) before they are really worth it.There are many positives about this. I have the G2 doorbell Pro.- It does a great job of capturing video of anything that triggers it.- the video actually starts a few seconds before the motion sensors trigger. so it is constantly recording and overwriting the last several seconds of video until it is triggered- this means you will capture video of things that trigger the motion sensor- the down side, do not believe that you will be able to interact with people at the door- they will have most likely left before you even receive a motion alert- I have on many occasions gone to live view when alerted, only to see no one there. But when the recording becomes available several minutes later, you see the entire action from just before the alert for a full minute of video of the area.- the good news is, the unit will start recording again if there is additional movement after the recording stops, so unlike the G1 they cannot trip and wait for the recording to stop.- If the person is legit, delivery or whatever, they will do what they are there to do, drop off a package or ring the doorbell (which is another trigger)- if they are up to no good (stealing packages), they will be captured on video but you will most likely not see who or what until after they are gone. Certainly information that can be shared with police and neighbors.- I have seen many postings on the Ring neighborhood network, good for the detectives and for neighborhood watch.12/26 Update Changed from 1 star to 5 starRing support reached out and helped me troubleshoot my doorbell. They then sent me a replacement Doorbell Ring Pro. This did require me to replace my doorbell transformer and it is a bit smaller so it would not fit on my corner mount. But it came with 2 angled mounts. And they offered to send me another if the included one did not angle it enough but was not needed.I installed the replacement and could immediately tell the difference. Setting the motion zones is easy and offers much more flexibility for where you want motion to be detected. It also has the ability to setup more than one motion zone.The best thing about this version, when someone/something triggers the motion, it actually starts recording the person/object way out at the motion edge you defined. No more only seeing someone leave your property in the recording. This doorbell is great. It does require more Internet bandwidth, but the difference is amazing.Thanks Rings Support for helping resolve my issues.I do wish it were a bit less expensive. but I am sure that will be the case all in good time.------------------------------------------------------------------OriginalI like the idea, however this comes up short. I set the sensitivity to pick up motion in the driveway, long before they would get to my front door. This works sometimes, but mostly triggers as they are leaving my doorstep. As many others have posted, you get a good recording of people walking away. I have had flies and crickets trigger the motion sensor, but more frequently the wind is causing enough motion of bushes or trees to set it off. But when delivery drivers pull up, park and walk up, it fails to pick them up. It does capture them if they ring the doorbell.Some other things to be aware of:- You get a 30 day free recording, after 30 days, you must sign up and pay $3/month or $30/year if you prepay for the year, to save and access video recordings from a single device.- If you have more than one device, the fee is $10/month or $100/prepaid year, more economical with 4 or more devices- I have not figure out how to access this from a DVR and have the recordings saved locally.- Overpriced, the doorbell is a little pricey, but nothing compared to the floodlight security cameras. Odds are, you would have a single doorbell, but you might want multiple floodlight cameras on other areas of your property.  At a whopping $249 each, they are way overpriced. A security camera system costs less and you do get to control the recordings on a DVR.',\n",
       " \"The concept of this product,  being able to answer your door when  you are not home or tied up, appealed to me  and so I ordered it.  Here is what I found when I installed it:  1.  You need to know that this unit will NOT function without INTERNET connectivity!!!!  No, you cannot connect to the device via your home network.  No, you cannot view video direct from the camera.  No, the device is not usable unless you create an account on the company servers.  2.  Some of the problems that the above limitation causes are the following:  A.  Because you connect to this device from your phone via an app that requires the use of a company server, there is a considerable delay from the time someone activates the button or trips the sensors (if you have them turned on) to the time the app on your phone goes off.  Depending upon conditions on the Internet and the state of the company's servers, this can be 15 seconds to 2 minutes.  In that amount of time, people may wait or they may leave.  If they are dropping off a package and you have the sensors activate, the effect is all you get is a picture of them leaving or no picture at all.  B.  The company's servers have been off line several times.  During that time, your product is non-functional and the app on your phone will tell you that YOU have a problem with the Internet even though the real problem is that the company is offline.  How do I know this?  Because I can connect to e-mail, web pages, IM, etc., wihtout problems and only this app will not work.  C.  If you are trying to answer from a remote location, which I have tried several times, there can be a long delay between when people say something to you and when you hear a response.  3.  If you have this unit also connected to your door bell, that door bell may or may not work when people press the button.  Apparently you can press it lightly and the light on the button activates as well as the app, but it does NOT ring your interior door bell.  To ring the door bell requires the user to fully push and hold the button down for a couple of seconds!!!  4.  Viewing videos is a bit of problem on a phone since you do NOT get a large image and you cannot zoom into see detail!!!!  What you see is what you get and that is not all that great if you are trying to identify who is at your door.  Especially if there is a theft involved!!  5.  They have improved one thing.  Originally, you could not view live video on demand.  You can do that now, but do NOT expect instant video!!  It can take several seconds for the connection to come up since you are linking from the unit to the company servers, back to your network, then to the app on your phone.  Again,NO zoom feature.  6.  The light sensitivity is decent and with normal porch lights on at night you get a decent picture.  This is basically a pin hole sense, so you get a round image much like the original picture tubes on the first televisions if you are old enough to remember that or have visited a museum on such things.I really like the concept, but think that the company needs to make some changes.  Specifically, they need to make this a stand alone system that does NOT require their server to work!!  You should be able to just link back to your home network through your router to the device.  I can understand having an option of using the company if you want so that you can have stored video offline, but that should NOT be a functional requirement of the device to work.  As I have seen, too many times the device is useless at home because the company servers are down, have an issue, or there is a problem with traffic on the Internet.  if it ran on your home network none of the above would be an issue when you re at home!!!!\",\n",

I'm 68 years old, so if I can do it, ANYBODY can do it! We are very pleased with the quality of the video and audio.

       " 'I finally decided to order a Ring device, specially after being victim of a couple package thefts. Mainly because most of the mail carriers absolutely refuse (even after asking them several times, and using the online tools for delivery instructions) to ring the bell when delivering a package, so packages are left outside unattended until I notice them (I work from home).I love the idea of this device, and so far I have been able to talk to a couple of mail carriers (when they ring the bell!) and ask them to place packages elsewhere or go out and retrieve them when I’m notified that motion is detected.The biggest drawback is the motion detection that seems to take about a second to react and start recording and send out a notification (even when set at the most sensitive setting). It is sensitive enough to detect cars down the road but when someone approaches the door/porch area, it only triggers the detection/recording when the person is already leaving, so if you want to use it for face recognition this won’t work for you. I\\'m pretty sure if a thief comes and steals a package, I would only be able to see/record him as he\\'s leaving.Check out my video review with actual detected footage.A couple of things I want from a future firmware update:- Ability to reboot the device remotely from the app or web UI (the only way to do it currently is to remove the device from the baseplate and push the setup button).- Ability to change motion settings remotely without having to push the ring button for them to take effect.- Ability to add time/date information to the recorded footage.- Better and more accurate motion detection.- Ability to record 24/7 for those times when the motion detection fails. You\\'re paying a monthly/yearly premium for recoding, so why not make it available at all times?12/10/2015 Update: Ring has stopped detecting motion just 3 days shy of the 30-day trial, definitely not a good sign. I have contacted tech support and they sent out a new unit. One star knocked down - more updates to come...01/09/2016 Update: Ring customer care just doesn\\'t seem to care. I was sent a total of 3 replacement units and the first two I had to send back because they sent the wrong color. The third unit I received was the correct color, but it looked used and completely beat up.... I\\'m sending that one back as well, ugh!1/19/2016 Update: Finally received the correct color replacement unit. The camera still won\\'t detect a human being as it approaches the door, the delay for the motion detection to react is unacceptable (no matter how \\'sensitive\\' the motion detection is set, it only detects people as they walk away). At this point, I\\'ve lost hope until a MAJOR firmware update is pushed out to fix all these annoying issues.3/16/2016 Update: Of course Ring decided to come up with the \"Video Doorbell Pro\" now, which addresses all the motion detection issues mentioned by so many. Instead of fixing the issues on the first generation, you now have to spend another $249 for the \"advanced motion detection\" which does exactly what the first generation one promised to do.4/7/2016 Update: After MONTHS for complaining and going back and forth with tech support (which caused me to miss Amazon\\'s return window due to empty promises from tech support), I was finally put in contact with a senior supervisor who stated that the device\\'s PIR sensors are only designed to work on a flat linear plane and therefore since there are 2 steps to get to my front door, there is no way for the unit to detect the motion correctly. The solution offered was to angle the device downward 20-30 degrees to try to resolve the motion detection issues. Of course this would look absolutely hideous!I can only recommend for anyone looking to get a Ring just to wait for the Ring Pro to come out (late April 2016), unless you really need to depend on the battery power.',\n",
       " 'These doorbells were pretty good when they came out 3 years ago. Unfortunately Ring hasn\\'t kept up with advancements in technology since then or brought the price down so that they end up being over priced for what you get. The requirement to \"push the doorbelI\" to save changes from the phone app is absurd. The effect is you cannot make changes if you\\'re out of town.If you only need one doorbell at one property they\\'re still a pretty good deal but if you have multiple properties the cloud storage fee becomes prohibitive. They really need to offer an all you can drink plan for no more than $10 per month that provides for multiple locations. And, inexplicably, the camera only models without the doorbell functionality cost more rather than less. If these products were more affordable I would be willing to buy a dozen or more. At the current price structure there are better alternatives.',\n",
       " \"For six months, doorbell worked perfectly then started acting up.  At first, it wouldn't take a charge via hardwired set up and then lost connection altogether despite repeated charging via USB charger.  I contacted Ring for warranty support and was forced into a never-ending, troubleshooting do loop.  It got really tedious when Ring asked me to wire it one way and then reconnect with the wires reversed.  On top of that, they wanted me to document my troubleshoot escapades with pictures.  As an Amazon company, I thought Ring was reputable, but I quickly learned it's not the case.  I then began to read the reviews (I know...I should have done this first), and found others had similar problems and stories.  I'm hugely disappointed with Ring, but this storm cloud does have a silver lining:  This is my first Ring purchase.  Therefore, I'm minimally invested in the Ring ecosystem.  I was looking to buy other security/smart home products and now know that I need to look elsewhere.  Bottom line:  Don't hit the buy now button!Update:  15 Jun 19After posting this review on Amazon, I was contacted by Danielle, a Ring Neighborhood Advocate.  She contacted me via e-mail and requested an opportunity to speak by phone.  I agreed and found her extremely nice and truly interested in solving my problem.  I explained the situation, and Danielle was very quick to offer several solutions.  In the end, she really turned things around.  In terms of the doorbell itself, I'm on the fence; however, I really appreciate Danielle and how she saved the day.  For that reason, I'm upgrading my rating from 1-Star to 4-Stars.\",\n",
       " \"I have been using the Ring 1 video doorbell for over a year now and it is disappointing.  My house faces north and the porch is about 4' covered and shaded. As a result, everything out of the shaded area is so badly overexposed that it is impossible to make anything out.  Based on what I've found online, this is a problem Ring has been promising to solve since at least 2016.  Reports are that the updated firmware made the problem worse and now Ring Support has no way to adjust exposure.The motion sensor is quite slow.  When I receive a notification the video is of the visitor's back walking away into the overexposed sunlight.  This occurs even when they ring the bell.  I have tried all settings and vehicles driving by in the street 30+ feet away trigger notifications.  It got so bad I had to turn off notifications so my phone didn't buzz every time a car drove past the house.  I tried Ring's suggestion to use the angle mount but all that did was shift the overexposed area to another part of the screen.Ring's recommendation today seems to be to upgrade to later models (at twice or more the price and which will require drilling additional holes in the brick for the new mounting plate).  I will have to find someone that has installed the twice-the-price model before I consider upgrading. Really sad to ask someone dissatisfied with the product to buy a new version of the same for twice as much on faith.Ring's other suggestion for the overexposure problem is to add additional surveillance cameras for those areas! So your product doesn't work well and, to fix it, I should buy more of your products to make up for the original product's defects?  I don't think so.  Take a chance with the Ring 2 if you are brave or look for another product.\",\n",
       " 'We had a few problems getting it setup so that the app and our normal doorbell worked simultaneously. Once we got it figured out I really liked this product. I really like how videos are stored on the app for rings and/motion. My main complaint is that after the first month the videos are no longer available and you have to pay a monthly or yearly fee to access the videos. This is ridiculous considering how much the doorbell costs!',\n",
       " \"I’ve been wanting a video doorbell for the longest time, primarily for the ability to interact with the person at the door when I’m not at home. I don’t have hard wiring for a doorbell, so when I saw that you can buy a Ring chime that serves as the actual bell (separately from your phone), I decided it was time to take the plunge. I actually didn’t know the gadget also works as a motion sensor. That *should* come in handy - I can see who’s about to ring my doorbell and decide if I want to answer before the bell even rings. It doesn't work that well, though (details below).Setup was super easy. Charge the bell, pair it with the Wi-Fi, put a few screws in the bracket, slip the bell housing into place on the bracket, and done. (Setup for the Ring chime was also very simple, and they paired very easily.)The doorbell function works well. You have a choice of chime noises and other settings. This app doesn't work well on my office Wi-Fi, but that's an issue with the VPN and not Ring. I do get a notification that the doorbell is ringing, but I can't quickly load the video feed to see who's there and respond. In all other settings, this works fine.I had to play with the motion field settings so I don’t get notified every time a car drives by. I still get a couple of notifications that don’t seem to be caused by anything in particular - and sometimes when a car drives by. I also notice that the video function doesn’t seem always kick in immediately, so a quick delivery, for example, may not be recorded until the person is walking *away* from my door. Sometimes, deliveries aren't detected at all. I do see cars when they pull up in my driveway, which is good. I recently was out of town for a few days, and the Ring didn't detect my petsitter's comings and goings at all.Still, the best feature as far as I’m concerned is that I don’t have to be in my house to respond to the person ringing the doorbell. I can be in my back yard (where I wouldn’t normally hear the bell), I can be walking my dog a few blocks away, I can be a thousand miles away, and I can still answer my doorbell and tell the person I can’t come to the door right now (or maybe “be right there…” or “I’m not joining your church!”). The video function definitely works best if you’re on a Wi-Fi network, but I do immediately get the notification that someone is at the door, even if I can’t tune the video in quickly.\",\n",
       " 'I am a technology geek and was an early adopter and supporter of the Ring doorbell. My experience here is based on three of years of use. Unfortunately I can no longer support the Ring doorbell and will be replacing it with a Nest doorbell. Ring replaced the doorbell once because it appeared that the California coastal moisture would cause it to stop responding. The replacement fixed the first problem, but created a new issue. It centered around the doorbell switching back and forth between thinking it was hardwired and on battery - even though it was hardwired. When it thought it was on battery it would run out of power and I got a message saying I needed to recharge it. Ring resolution said to turn down the amount of activity it captured which seems to defeat the whole purpose of having this very expensive doorbell. Then suddenly it would change back to think it was hardwired, recharge, and all was fine. Multiple calls and emails to Ring did not help, they just kept giving me a run around of check the voltage, what kind of chime do you own, does it work if you cross the terminals, take a picture of the wiring... Search of the Internet shows that other people have had a similar issue. This is at our vacation home and I can no longer trust it.',\n",
       " 'I was really excited to order the Ring doorbell after reading about it on the internet. Upon receiving the Ring my husband installed it on our front door. We set the motion sensor to between 5-10 feet. Within minutes we began to receive notifications of motion outside our door. When we checked to see the motion that was detected it ended up simply being a car driving down our block, about 25 feet away from where the Ring device was mounted. Not a problem, you say? Well, firstly it can get pretty annoying when each time a car drives by you are alerted about motion outside your door. The bigger issue was that on dozens of occasions motion taking place immediately outside our door failed to be detected at all. A few times when I left the house in the morning or returned in the evening my activity did not set off the motion sensor. The same happened with my husband and children when they exited or entered our house. It was really ironic that this device which was supposed to be a security measure of sorts did not get triggered on dozens of occasions when we were literally opening the front door of our home, but detected our neighbor across the street mowing his lawn. The only positive comments I can make are about the ease of installation and the customer service representatives. We had the device set and mounted within a few minutes. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. When I called the toll free number to try to troubleshoot the issues I was having, I received very courteous and efficient service. However none of the tips and tools I was offered helped fix the problems we continued to have. Within a week of having the device I returned it.',\n",
       " \"Okay so after having this for a year and looking at tall the pictures in the comments I believe that there is a problem with my Camera on my door bell. and that's besides all the alerts I get that ring is down. Also I had first ordered a Ding( by zmodo) and that camera was great, only reason I returned it was cause of the spotty connection to my router but the picture was far more superior to the ring. only time I can actually see people is when they are within 6 feet of the doorbell do to the camera. but with the Ding I could see people in the street.  I talked to tech support on multiple occasions and all the did was adjust the camera from there end . it never helped. but I look at some of the pictures here and see almost the same front to their home and the picture is great. so I can only give this 1 star now do to all this.\",\n",
       " 'At first I was pleased with the functionality of this product however once the battery level drains down it then becomes obvious how poorly designed this product really is. You nearly have to destroy yhe product in order to replace the battery, and batteries are not readily available for the product. You have to remove 8 very tiny screws and pry off an aluminum cover and plastic back that also has orings sround the pushbutton, just to be able to get to the battery in order to replace it.  This is very time consuming and tedious and the battery only lasts for a couple of months so this has now turned out to be a device I will have to add to my junk device collectio9n. Any Company claiming they have a good design and that charges as mmuch as RING for the device and Subscriptions should have at a minimum designed an easier Battery replacement.  Rather than replace the battery on this device I will simply never use the device again and cancel my subscription. There are easier solutions on the martket. I know other Ring Doorbells can be attached via transformer for power however I had hoped this could be used in a location without doorbell wiring as it was ad vertised to work. unfortunately because of the effort needed to maintain it it is now worthless junk in my book and I do not normally berate any product but this one deserves the rating I give.',\n",
       " \"I bought this for my parents.  We installed it exactly as told and in the middle of the night the bell began ringing.  My dad disconnected it at the bell at 3:30 in the morning.  For the next three weeks we did everything the manufacturer told us to do.  This included going back the door bell manufacturer and getting copies of the original door bell install diagrams and providing pictures of all components for the door bell.  After nearly a month we got and email that said the door bell is not compatible.  so sorry!  Due to the time it took to let us know and agony of it all, Amazon will no longer take it back as a return.  Ring is horrible to deal with.  To not know it was not complicated to know from the original email we sent them that their system NEVER work with this type of chime.  Now i have a bell I cannot return.  Perhaps they know the exact length of time to hold you out on their emails and tech support so you fall a few days over their return limit.  I'll definitely remember that one!\",\n",
       " \"I originally gave Ring a rousing endorsement, recommended it to others in our HOA and on Facebook, but after extended use I'm very disappointed. Our system disconnected from our network a few months after being installed and didn't want to reconnect. I worked with Ring on several different occasions for what totaled more than six hours, each time having to go through the reset process multiple times. Per Ring's own techs, their testing showed the connection was fine, good internet connection speeds, system self tests, but failed to display a clear picture or detect a push button on occasion or approach of a person. One tech sent me a 300 mbps range extender even though his testing showed good connection speeds, it did nothing to resolve the problems. Another tech reported the doorbell failed system self tests and he sent a new Ring doorbell which worked OK for a week or so, then started having the same problems as the first one. The picture received was low quality, the alerts received steadily degraded to the point you may or may not receive one, and when you do the video is best choppy and at worst non-existent, even on a very good internet connection. Now alerts are extremely rare; if the product didn't function as a doorbell, I'd have ripped it out. Ring stopped returning phone calls and emails, apparently the way they avoid responding to a failed product.\",\n",
       " 'Update: After writing this review I was contacted by ring directly and their customer service department offered to help me troubleshoot my doorbell issues. They worked with me for several weeks to sort out the issue... turns out I didn’t have quite the right set up for my doorbell location. They worked with me consistently until the issue was resolved and it was probably the best customer service I have received from any company ever. So that is a huge plus. My improved setup seems to be working much better now, so maybe my suggestion would be to do some research on your house and the various options to see what works best for you to get optimal results. Overall I’m satisfied. Hopefully it’s presence just deters the bad guys...Well... I wish this worked. But it doesn’t. It picks up every single garbage truck or car on the street despite me adjusting the settings over and over again, however 3 people walked into my house on 3 separate occasions and it never even picked up a hint of it. Didn’t pick up the entrance and didn’t pick up the exits. We were on vacation and I had a few of my family members come in to check on the place, long story short I became EXTREMELY upset with them while I was gone because according to my ring, they never showed up. I know the damn thing was working because I got video footage of every f****** car that drove by every single day, but yeah no one entering or existing the house showed up. I know they came because at the end of the trip all of the mail they were collecting was on the counter and the plants were sufficiently watered. I only now feel compelled to write this because someone just came running up to the door screaming and pounding on the door before taking off. Silly neighborhood kids... whatever, but, did the ring record any of it? Of course not, but 3 minutes later I got a very nice video of a car. Do not buy this piece of crap. The only reason I bought this was because the neighborhood has a porch pirate problem... i figured if nothing else the darn thing would deter them, but rest assured, someone could enter the house, murder us all and it wouldn’t pick up any evidence. Do not buy this unless you want 75 video alerts a day of cars. Going to rip it off the house and put it in the street for one of the cars to run over. Won’t get that footage, but at least I’ll be rid of the stupid thing.',\n",

       " \"I purchased two of these for two homes in two different states.  When they work - they are great and do what they are supposed to do.  The problem is, there are some issues about how they work and if you are using this at a location where you are not physically present, they are actually pretty horrible.For some reason, a short time after the second doorbell was added to my account, both devices went offline from my app.  The doorbell would still ring and was still connected to the wifi, but the app itself saw them as offline, so no live view, no activity, no anything.  I contacted tech support via chat.  It's nice that they are available 24/7 and we were able to get the doorbell in my current location back up and running by doing a complete reset and re adding it.  The problem is - and it's really a fatal flaw for me - is the device at my other home about 1000 miles away can't be brought back online until I am there in person to take it off and press the orange button for 15 seconds.If the cable company can figure out how to remotely reset a cable box, you think the same could be done with a doorbell.  So now I am not capturing any video at my other home.  I don't know if anyone is there and I am basically back having an ordinary but expensive doorbell that doesn't do anything but ring.  It will be this way until I travel there and push that button for 15 seconds (after removing the doorbell which is also kind of a paint).  Really quite unacceptable.  Luckily, my ADT security system is working fine and I'm not worried from a security standpoint, but kind of disappointed in purchasing a device that seems to go off line from time to time and can't be reset until you are there in person.  Will probably return these and look for other options.\",\n",

Vidio was hit or miss to.  Its  set up was relatively easy and at the kitchen table it appeared to working but not as I would expect.  Door bell would ring,  notifications would arrive at the phone but not right away.  There was a bit of a lag.  Ten feet away on the other side of the wall and mounted at the door it didn't get any better.Also bought the range  extender with chime too just in case there was connection issues.  This was located in line of sight to the router and 6 feet away from the door bell on the other side of the wall.  It would not sync right no matter what.  The wifi address would pop up on my phone and it saw the router but would ask to be moved closer and closer to the router until it was inches from it and still would not connect.  The other ring devices saw the router as I would see it on my Phone.  The range extender saw the first and last characters in the routers connection name but made up other characters for the middle.

I've ran around 600-800 tests on this, starting from ringing the bell and the motion sensor. Here's what I've found:- When the doorbell is rung too many times in a day, your device will be knocked off wifi. Keeping this connected to wifi appears to be a chore, and mine is only 25 feet away. There is also no warning that your device has been knocked off the network either. So you can go a whole month or two without ever knowing this thing is offline.- Walking sensor is utter rubbish. I turned this on the highest settings and it misses humans coming to the door more than 75% of the time. When it does pick something up, it's usually too late because it take a whole 30 seconds for the app to load and bring the picture up.Why is this important, the average criminal is going to wait 10-15 seconds to hear if they see or hear movement on the inside of the house before they move to the back yard. So by the time you get your app open at the 32 second mark, the criminal will either already have your package or be in your back yard.Don't let the videos they post on their own channel fool you, this thing is a grade A piece of rubbish.

I have a wireless house covered with security cameras (Arlo) that I have no problems with. Either I keep getting bad Rings or they’re just not ready for prime time.Update. 2/28/19.The folks at Ring contacted me after reading my review and, after a few questions (basically determining whether or not I was a total incompetent) decided to replace my Ring Doorbell with a Ring Doorbell 2. After some initial setup issues (still a little quirky and buggy), I was able to install the new unit. It’s trial came while I was away on business for 11 days, a true test. Verdict? I like the 2 a lot better. Battery life is longer, and the new battery design means you don’t have to remove the entire unit to charge it; just take the battery out. The manufacturer was kind enough to supply me with a spare battery, as battery life had been one of my issues with the previous unit. The battery life is outstanding, but, for continuous coverage I recommend getting a second battery.I’m very pleased with the 2, and also very pleased with the response from customer service.',\n",

If you have a functioning doorbell (if you don't you can get a cheap wireless one for about $30), you will be much happier with a separate ip camera with motion detection and a phone app  with notifications.

       " 'Believe the negative reviews!!! Returning this Ring. This version of the ring does not live up to the hype (You need the Pro or higher for you to get the functions Ring is known for).  This version of Ring uses Infrared for motion, so if you have a vehicle, hot pavement, virtually anything with a heat signature within view of the doorbell, motion sensors wil NOT activate! Even if you follow all their suggested trouble shooting solutions. To get true motion activation, you have to buy one of the more expensive versions like the Pro. The sound didn’t even work at all. When someone rings the doorbell, I could talk to them, but it does not pick up what they are saying at all! Just a loud buzz is all you hear on the app. None of the trouble shooting suggestions fixed this issue either. And what they don’t say is, you will have to pay a monthly subscription to view, record or save any of your video. So be prepared to be on the hook for that. I’m going to look into PC Magazine’s best video doorbells of 2018 (This version of Ring scores too low to be one of the editor’s choices.)  The top two are Skybell (it’s free to view, record and save your videos) and August Doorbell Cam Pro - these two score the highest. I’ll be checking them out. Don’t waste your money on this version of Ring. If you have to have a Ring, go with the Ring Pro. It seems to be the one that does the things advertised.

       " 'So I wanted to get one of these for a while, and once the price came down I jumped on it.  I am so impressed with this product and this company, that I feel compelled to write a very detailed review of my experience so far with both.When I first received the package, I was extremely impressed with how much care went into the customer experience, even down to the experience of opening the box, etc.  Everything is highly organized and guides you easily through the steps to get your unit up and running.  The first thing you\\'re greeted with is also their 24/7 800 #, just in case you have an issue, which I found to be very reassuring.The unit comes with step by step directions so simple a small child could probably follow them, and they even include the tools you will need to install the entire unit with including a drill bit in case you have to install the bell on a masonry surface (They dont include a drill though, just the bit).You are led to install their app on your phone first which is extremely simple, and you will need to have high speed wireless wifi for this to work.  Once you install the app, right inside the the app they\\'ve included excellent high quality instructional videos which guide you through the entire installation, no matter which way you\\'re doing it.  I found the videos to be simple, right to the point, a very big help and incredibly easy to follow.The installation in my opinion was very easy, and took me about 25 minutes total.  It turned out that I had done two things wrong though, which I did not know at the time.  So I immediately called customer service at 10pm mind you, to see if they could help.  After about a 3 minute wait I was connected with an American tech support rep, who was friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful.  He wound up staying on the phone with me for probably 45 minutes, walking me through every trouble shooting step till we identified the problem (which turned out to be an issue with my phone, not the device, and that I had failed to install the included diode for my hard wired digital bell).Once we identified the issues, he walked me through fixing everything, and would not let me off the phone until we tested the bell three times, and it was ringing in the house, and to my phone each time flawlessly.  The customer service was absolutely excellent, and top notch.Since the installation, I absolutely LOVE this product.  I had the first visitor today who rang the bell, and I was able to see them and talk to them from the comfort of my backyard, which was awesome.  The Live View feature is just fantastic as well, and at any point you can turn that on and see whats going on outside right to the street.  The camera is SUPERB, as it\\'s a very wide angle camera, and no matter where the person is on the stoop, they are seen by it.They\\'d basically have to be laying flat up against your front door with their faces and bodies pressed to it to hide from the camera, and even then you\\'d still see some of them!  It\\'s really just a top notch camera all around.  The picture is crystal clear and in color as well, and the night vision really works too.  If there\\'s enough ambient light, you even get color footage at night!  Can\\'t say enough good things about the camera.The speaker two way talking works great as well, I was able to have a conversation with a visitor with no issues and both our voices were clear as a bell.  The app works extremely well and alerts you as soon as the bell rings in a manner of your choosing, including a traditional door bell chime on your phone, up to a voice announcing \"there\\'s someone at your front door\".Once you click the alert it opens up the live view immediately, and you can view and talk to the visitor; from anywhere you are with wifi in the world.  Which I again think is absolutely awesome, even more incredible that it really works!You can get alerts if there\\'s any motion as well, and you can set the motion range (up to 30 ft away) to whatever distance you are comfortable with.  The phone will then alert you in any way you choose when ever there is motion outside in range.  Be careful though because its very sensitive.  Most likely a grasshopper will set it off lol..But the great thing is if you don\\'t want motion alerts?  You can simply disable them, and just get doorbell alerts.I really cannot say enough good things about this product, the company, or the system they have set up here.  Everything is ultra-intuitive and designed with the customer in mind, the customer service is Top Tier (and not outsourced to India, so they\\'re creating American Jobs), and they really stand behind their product.I am very, very satisfied with my purchase and my overall experience, 5 big stars and a very enthusiastic A+++++++++ from this customer, Thanks!!',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve had this doorbell for about two months now and it\\'s been doing pretty good but there are some issues that are worth writing about.First off, the motion detection feature sends me motion notifications way too often because 95% of the time it picks up cars passing by. There are some ways to adjust the motion detection area but it hasn\\'t helped me a bit, if not made it worse. There is a feature where it will ask you questions like \\'How many feet away are cars from the doorbell?\" or \"Are there any steps leading up to the door?\" in order to fix the detection area but that hasn\\'t helped. There is also a feature where you can manually move the detection area but along with the questions, it hasn\\'t fixed anything.Second, when the doorbell records when people come up to the door it often records when they are leaving the door and not coming up to it. Which makes no sense because you can not see their face or what they did at the door. I also tried to see if moving the detection zone would do anything but that didn\\'t work. The only time I see the person\\'s face is if they ring the doorbell and if they don\\'t leave so quickly.Now, I do like a good amount of stuff about the product that make up a little bit for the things I did not like. Setting up the doorbell didn\\'t take to long and it came with everything you needed to install it. The paper instructions overall were pretty clear, but I prefer watching a video about installing it. The camera quality of the Ring is good and exceeded my expectation and the area the camera can see is pretty wide. When you purchase Ring you will be prompted to download the Ring app which is possibly one of my most favourite things about the Ring Doorbell. The app is really user-friendly and it has a lot of features I really enjoy. Through the app, you are able to talk to people who approach your door which I find as a very useful feature. For example, you can see if people around your neighborhood have published recordings and if there were any recently reported crime incidents. Overall, The product had some pros and cons but mostly pros which is why I give it 3 stars out of 5.',\n",
       " \"The Ring doorbell I purchased was easy to install and get working. The app interface is not very intuitive and can be a little confusing to navigate even for the tech-savvy.  However, my disappointment is in the performance of the device. It is slow to detect motion and is inconsistent in what it detects and alerts. From what I have read, the former could be caused by a weak WiFi signal. Based on the fact that my WiFi router is less than 30 feet away, the doorbell itself has poor reception capabilities and that is why Ring sells signal boosters. I have a 1500 square foot home and the signal from my WiFi can be picked up by my cell phone on the street in front of my home, a good 60 feet away from the doorbell which sits between the router and the street where I can pick up the signal. Night vision capability is nonexistent. All I can see is a light spot on the wall next to the doorbell. My assessment is the doorbell itself has a built-in weakness with WiFi reception to force owners to purchase signal boosters.I don't have any experience, anecdotal or actual with other competitive devices, but so far I am not impressed with the performance. I am impressed with some of the features, particularly integration with Alexa. I can simply say Alexa, show me the front door and it appears on my TV set. I am fortunate to have a TV set that will automatically switch HDMI input when the activity is detected on the Alexa-enabled Fire TV device.Bottom line is that it is better than nothing.\",\n",
       " \"We have bought several Ring products thru here and other places and have them installed at several properties, and have also bought several as Christmas gift. In addition, we have recommended this product to our colleagues, neighbors, and family from Los Angeles to New York City and Canada, so we were shocked and very disappointed in the latest dealing with their Customer Support when facing set up problems with one of our ring cameras for our Orlando home.We are on the road about 90% of the time, but have a family member living on our home in Orlando and taking care of it, so after setting up the ring video camera - we get a call after the thanksgiving holidays that it's not working, so we told our cousin - no worries, ring customer service is great; well they were.Called ring and was told that because we were on the road, we had to delete my account for orlando ring and have our cousin set up new device, so while more time consuming than I had hoped in fixing a live camera view problem - we did it. One problem, the agent forgot to tell us that the video annual plan we bought would not transfer to new account, so after completing his request - a week later, our cousin was now not being able to access video and being told that she had to pay for annual plan.Not happy with having to waste more time on this simple technical issue, but things happen so I again called ring - and was not told by new agent that the other agent told us the wrong thing - when i deleted the account and had our cousin set up a new device as the owner, we deleted the annual video plan we had payed for.Who is on first, What is on Second?So we are now told to reverse what we were told to do in order to get our annual plan back (which we have already paid for), and then when we ask for a supervisor - the supervisor by the name of Kevin C in Phoenix keeps us on hold for over 20 minutes, and tells the agent that he has no time to talk to us.Conclusion: This used to be a great product, but this experience is making us consider returning the Christmas ring products we had bought, and that maybe Ring has grown too fast and not trained their customer support supervisors/agents adequately.\",\n",
       " \"It all worked for 2.5 hours.  Then it somehow killed my wired doorbell system.  After replacing the chime, it had to have been the doorbell terminal.  So we went with the battery method.  Corrosion was present on the harness and unit 2 days after installation.After the 2nd charging, about 2 weeks later, the colors were no longer corrrect and the doorbell portion stopped working.  The led button stopped lighting up, but we were still getting motion notifications.Just removed the included hardware for a return and the screws were rusted, so not an exterior grade screw, either.  It was not out in any extreme cold or heat since it is only spring here.If you are installing inside your home, it might work for you.  But based on my experience and several other reviews, on this site, if you want to install it outside try something else.Update: decided to give it another try, using it inside the porch until I can get an electrician out to put in a new wired doorbell system.  The harness doesn't seem to fit the doorbell right.  It comes right off, unlike our 1st one.\",\n",
       " 'First and foremost. I am an engineer with over 40 years of experience in designing this kind of crap. I\\'m not a noob at setting this kind of stuff up. Before you fall for the hype, find a friend that has one and find out the real truth about how much effort and expense went into getting it working and ask them for a demo to see what kind of quality and lag they get.We fell for the hype and ordered one of these for my 90+ year old father in law to keep him from having to get up and hobble across the house every time the doorbell rang. He had an Android smartphone and knew pretty well how to make use of it after a couple of years of working with it. The doorbell arrived and I went over to install it.Surprise 1. After trying to download the app from the play store I was informed that \"my version of android was just too old and decrepit to run this app\" Buried in the fine print it says you better have the latest and greatest Android OS or you\\'re screwed. His phone of course could not be upgraded. After another $300 for a refurb Galaxy phone with \"acceptable\" OS and another week gone by I install the app and finally get the doorbell talking to the router and the app. This of course doesn\\'t include the time to change phones, port the existing number, transfer contacts, photos, etc and show him how to use the new phone that is just enough different from the old one to make things difficult.Surprise #2. After finally configuring the app so it wouldn\\'t alert whenever anyone with a ring doorbell within 5 miles was rung (and likewise we didn\\'t wish to share every bodily function with the connected neighborhood)  we were able to start testing it. Even sitting in the same room as the router with plenty of signal strength, the network delay between the doorbell, audio and video on the phone was horrible - on the order of seconds.Surprise #3. I finally install the Ring unit in place of the existing front doorbell button. We go to test it and it detects it only about 1 in 3 times the button is pressed, the lag is worse and video and audio are breaking up when they are there at all.  I check the signal level - its -62-65db at the doorbell and only one room away outside. No re-orientation of the router helps and moving it is a non-starter. Soooo.... now its another $50 for a signal booster. Tab so far for this \"$100 wonder\" is $450.  I\\'m awaiting the booster which may help the reliability ratio of rings to notifications but I doubt if will help the still present network lag. I guess you\\'re just supposed to pretend you\\'re talking to someone on the Moon and accept for the delay.In short, I didn\\'t find this product to be anything it claims and should have just sent it back when I discovered the software incompatibility. To date it has cost my father in law some $450+ dollars and numerous hours of my time and at this point I believe it will be just another unused gadget because its poor performance makes it more of a hassle to use than just getting up and hobbling to the front door. I definitely won\\'t be recommending it to friends or family.',\n",
       " 'This was one of the most disappointing ring products ever purchased. No it\\'s not the wifi signal that customer service tries to tell you being the problem cause it ring doorbell is literally in a room next to the doorbell with Xfinity\\'s gigabit service and yet unbelievably all ring products don\\'t even support 5 ghz signal they can only accept 2.4 ghz (which can mean a slower streaming experience) however processing power must be taken into account.I have all 3 Ring products, the Ring Floodlight, the Ring stick up cam (solar power) and of course the disappointing Ring Doorbell. Of all three, the Floodlight is the best, it captures motion with almost no delay and excellent night vision and sound.The Ring stick up cam comes in second with less options for motion zone controls and some delay in motion detection of about 5-10 seconds which still is hardly acceptable but tolerable.Last the Doorbell, the bottleneck. There is so much delay that items can be stolen easily within seconds. At times I could walk up to the door and it doesn\\'t notify me until 15 seconds later and this is on a super high speed network with 50 mbps download and 40 mbps upload and it could be faster if it were capable of being compatible with 5ghz at 500 mbps to 1ghz download BUT then I guess they should have thought about that limit and stress a micro processor instead.I\\'m just down cause I like the chime and the inconspicuous look that anyone would be better off buying simply only the floodlights in front instead of this doorbell. I should have just done that.***update***Ring tech support reached out right away and provided an ear full of my experience then provided a Chime Pro just to see if it improved. I received the Ring Chime Pro in a few days and the results were that it\\'s NOT the weak internet signal but that is was a weak RSSI signal. Due to the product\\'s inability to transmit a strong static signal through a wall/walls it results in a \"weak signal\" however even though the Ring Doorbell still lacks that part, the improved RSSI from 70 down to 60 makes a good difference by not losing signal.I feel as though many of the products still need to be refined in hardware, firmware, and software, it still gives me peace of mind knowing what\\'s happening outside my door so thank you tech support for your persistence in effort to accommodate.',\n",

The motion detection is very sensitive and easy to adjust with the Android app. There is also an app that works well with Windows 10 computers.

Ring CS is polite and tries to help, but their script fixes don't unscrew the failures I've experienced.Update: Nicole and Ring Developers fixed the problems by updating the Ring App. In addition, one of the devices had battery saving mode tuned on.

However, the problems started about 5 weeks after installation. I removed it to charge and once replaced, there was NO audio. SO I could see who was there, I just couldn't hear/speak to them. I emailed Ring and all of tried everything they proposed, to no avail. I was prepared to live with this since it was still useful as a doorbell. However, soon afterward it began giving ghost alerts - ring alerts when no one was at the door. Then finally, today it stopped working altogether. It's been about 6 weeks and the thing is dead.

       " 'I purchased this in October of 2018 and I didn\\'t have a strong enough signal for it to work. So I bought a WIFI extender. Still not strong enough signal. So I bought a better one from same company (netgear). Put it midway between the router and doorbell(about 35\\'. Total distance about 70\\') Still no good. I contacted NETGEAR who were great and told me how to use BOTH extenders. Put the better one at 35\\' and the less expensive one 25\\' from that right near the doorbell. It worked!...until a few days ago. Contacted RING who tell me that even though it has been working for 4 months that \"it\\'s not recommended to use 2 extenders\". Even though the Mbps signal is 6 times the strength RING recommends as the minimum signal strength of 2Mbps. (I have 25 Mbps download and 12 upload) The RING app says the signal the doorbell is getting is \"Better than most\" and \"only indicating minor interference\". My only option they told me was to run a 100\\' Ethernet cable and get a 2nd router in the room near the doorbell....which would be impossible for me to do without tearing up floors and walls! I asked why would it work for 4 months no problem? Why does the doorbell say it\\'s getting a good signal and why when I connect my phone directly to the WIFI signal the doorbell is getting from the 2nd extender does it show a signal 6 times stronger than the doorbell needs to operate? Can\\'t return it because you only get 30 days. I\\'d like to know where it says that you can\\'t use multiple extenders in the information either here on Amazon or on the RING website? It started working again so for right now it\\'s good. But a hit or miss video surveillance system really doesn\\'t give me the peace of mind I had in mind. I think it\\'s a cop-out to suggest that what worked for 4 months is now the issue as to why the doorbell is working on and off. It was great when it was working.',\n",

Adjusting the area of motion activation still does not work right after several days of messing with it.  Also, if you are trying to adjust it from off site, forget it.  After you save the new settings. you have to push the door bell to get it to work.  Good luck doing it from out of town.  The motion sensor once triggered takes over five minutes to re-set and record another 30 second clip.  So...burglers...if you want to rip off some packages, just toss something at the front door to trigger the motion activation, then you have plenty of time to rip off the packages that Amazon has left.  Not good.  As a professional photographer, I can tell you that the picture quality in definitely low quality.  First, the image distortion is truly the fisheye night mare of all times.  The dynamic range of the picture is very low end.  I have a very shallow porch which seems to properly exposed.  The yard is totally blown out highlights with no detail at all.

Those are entirely non-existent in my original sample.  The plastic casing is there for them, they just simply don\\'t exist.  QA defect?  Perhaps so.  But in 50% [n=2 ;-) ] of samples there are three PIR...  I stand behind the observation of my unit lacking motion detection circuitry, and the remainder of the experience as well; but that portion of the review (which I discounted anyway) needs to be viewed as a possible assembly/QA defect rather than indicative of the generation itself). /end edit]I would go beyond questioning the claims they make regarding their motion detection technology, being someone that has implemented those technologies many times in the CCTV world.

A courier can make it to my doorstep, scan the package, place it, ring the doorbell, and make it to the end of my 40\\' driveway before recording even starts.

Hardly gets used in the 7 months we've had it other than me testing it here and there I believe it's been used 3 times so there's no reason for the battery to get exhausted so soon. The other issue with it is the volume the people ringing the bell cannot hear us very good from either one of the phones we have connected to it. We also have a tough time hearing them as well.

I did the work and I knew what I was buying.  I had just moved into a new home, was receiving a lot of deliveries, and this was the perfect piece of mind.  Maybe I’d be happier with version 2 of the doorbell?  I don’t know.It looks good, and works as advertised.Love the app!Overall I’m happy with it, but it could be so much better.  I’m just not sure if there is anything better on the market at the moment.Dislikes:  WiFi signal is pretty weak for a device they KNOW is going to be used outside, while the router is inside. Mine is no more that 20ft away with no walls (other than the exterior wall) between it and its right on the edge of acceptable.  To contrast, my Roku that is 3 rooms away, through several walls and a greater distance has plenty of signal strength.I don’t like the image produced.  Not the quality, but the crazy wasted space of the fisheye.  Way too much boarder.As others have pointed out, the motion detection can drive you crazy.  I wish that was a little better implemented. For example, the garbage trucks set it off 100% of the time, yet someone walking to the door isn’t recorded until after they push the button?  They base the motion off the video, but it would work better if it had a dedicated motion detector similar to a yard light.  Almost every delivery that is dropped off starts with a shot of the driver walking away. If someone were to actually steel a package, I’d get a great pic of the back of their t-shirt as the walk away.Finally, the monthly bill is ridiculously expensive. It may seem inexpensive, but it’s not really.  It’s monthly or annually, and about 1/3rd of the purchase price.  Add a second device and that cost doubles, and without the monthly fee, it’s basically a REALLY expensive doorbell and webcam.

You say, \"Why don\\'t you adjust the motion sensor settings?\" I have. If you lower them to not detect a car at that range you subsequently lower the detection to 0 for human detection less than 5\\' from the camera as well. The worst part about the Ring system is that after 30 seconds of recording a motion detection, if the user doesn\\'t answer the call, the video is automatically shut off (even if you pay the semi-mandatory subscription fee).

However, technically it is a doorbell (as long as the battery holds out) and sometimes it even catches the person who rings it on video.  Most of the time there\\'s such a long delay that you never see the person who came up to your door.We\\'ve been dialing this thing in all weekend but it still goes off every time a car goes by, as if no setting was changed.  I\\'m starting to think maybe just maybe the \"settings\" you can change don\\'t actually do anything.The video is completely overexposed and there is no way to adjust the setting.  We can\\'t see a clear image unless the person stands still, in just the right spot.But sure, there\\'s a button to push that makes your phone and Alexa make noise.  So there\\'s that.',\n",
       " \"I purchased this a couple of years ago when the regular price was $200.  Even at the current price of $100, it's not that great.  The video quality is poor, not because it's only 720p, but because it uses too much compression for a soft image with blocky compression artifacts.  The software should allow different compression settings, but it doesn't.  The poor video quality is not due to a poor WiFi signal or internet speed (I checked and those are rock solid).The motion detection is absolutely awful.  No matter what settings I use, it throws up many false positives.  Even setting the motion zones down to only pickup motion within 8-10 feet of the device, it still triggers motion alerts for cars passing by on the street more than 30 feet away.  The software needs a smarter algorithm for detecting motion and/or a passive infrared sensor (different from the built-in infrared emitters) or microwave/radar sensor.  It also needs a 10 or so second memory buffer to pre-record when motion is detected.  As it is, without this, recorded clips due to motion are missing the first few seconds of the motion activity.On an iPhone 6 and 7, the app takes too long to launch and show a live view after receiving a ring or motion notification.I have an Amcrest indoor security camera that is able to achieve much, much better video quality even with a high compression/ low bitrate setting, so it is possible.  The Amcrest also detects motion much more reliably and its sensitivity settings actually seem to do something, unlike the Ring doorbell.  It also pre-records motion events by several seconds (it records me actually walking into the room before it detects my movement and sends the entire clip to the cloud).  Too bad the Amcrest is not a video doorbell.  The reason I mention the Amcrest is that the technology exists for much better video quality at low compression and low bitrates and for much more reliable motion detection.  And the Amcrest cost me less than $100 a few years ago.  Granted the Amcrest is a bit larger and has no battery backup.In conclusion, the device works in that you get notifications on your phone when someone rings the doorbell and can answer from anywhere.  The motion detection does not work well at all; it's pretty much useless.  The video quality is pretty bad.  This Ring doorbell seems almost like a prototype.  It's quite disappointing in many ways especially since the technology existed at the time of its release for it to be much, much better.  And from what I've read about the Ring Doorbell 2 and Doorbell Pro, they're not much of an improvement.\",\n",
       " \"We really wanted to love our Ring doorbell. We really did. It was miserable to install. First off, it wouldn't work with the chime we had, so we bought a new chime. Guess what? It didn't work with the new chime either. It seems that they want you to spend another $50 to buy their chime. So we did. We bought the one with the wifi extender on it. Glad we did. Apparently our wifi had a hard time passing through the front wall of the house. The one good thing about the install was their customer service. The rep from Ring stayed on the phone with my husband for over an hour before he suggested we go to Home Depot and buy their chime. We did, and it works perfectly. Another issue is the motion alerts. Every time we go out our front door we get a motion alert. Not good. So I turned off the sound for those alerts. I still get them in the app (silent) and have to delete them. I'm still trying to figure out how to turn them off altogether, but that's another story. I loved the video when someone rang the doorbell. I didn't realize (when I bought the Ring) that I would have to pay $30 a year to Ring to get the videos. So we did pay. Our old doorbell was mounted low and we had to use the same install spot because we have stucco, so our Ring is lower than it should be for good video. If you have an Apple watch, it will tell you that someone is at your door, but the app won't open on my phone. Thus, I'm too late to talk to whoever is at the door once I manually open the Ring app. I know, it seems like a lot of complaining, but I didn't realize my watch would conflict with the phone app, or that I would have to buy their chime, or that I would have to pay $30 a year for video. So now you know what we didn't know.\",\n",
       " \"Is not a real home security device. My bell went down suddenly and without warning. After many days of not working I called into support. They said it had been down for a while but never did I get a notification of the device being down. First major security flaw. When customer service could fix the problem by resetting the device, I was told it is a know problem and that I should wait for a fix. When I asked how exactly it will fix itself when it can't connect to the internet I was informed it just would. After many weeks of waiting for a magical fix I called in again to complain. This time I was hung up on. Long story short I had to escalate the problem to the BBB and a local new organization ignorer for the head of customer support to contact me to fix the problem. Ended up sending out a new unit that worked for a short period of time but went down at the first Denver area freeze. As a frustrating side not, I got an Echo show for Xmas which seems like it would be great for seeing the front door on a ring... WRONG only the Ring 2 and up can do that. SO the Ring unit I bought a year ago for $200 is completely outdated garbage and I would have to buy a new beer for another $200 a year later for a unit that will work. Oh and quite frequently I receive motion alerts but can't access the camera or see the video even hours later despite paying for the ,monthly service. To reiterate terrible product with even worse customer service. Save yourself some headache and buy the new Blink doorbell camera for half the price. Amazon recently purchased Blink also so Alexa integration is AMAZING!!\",\n",
       " \"As many have commented the concept is great, however it needs to be refined before the Ring W-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell can be the greatest since sliced bread.  Here are issues:  1-delivery) I hate that I purchased from Amazon.com on 12/1/17 and I have no idea when it will arrive.  When I ordered it was back ordered and to be shipped from Amazon on 12/4/17, however still on Ring.  I also purchased the same item from Ring.com and it arrived late also, it could be the color (Venetian). 2-battery) The battery is supposed to last between six months to one year, note I've had my Ring for less than one week and it's down to 76% using only zone 6.  At this rate I'll have to recharge the battery before my two months are up.  3-coverage) Zone 6 is supposed to cover five feet, however yesterday 12/8/17 it was covering the full range of 30 feet; picking up the trash, green waste, and recycle trucks which is annoying. 4-extender)  The Chime Pro is supposed to extend your Wi-Fi coverage, however I receive messages that the signal is weak; I’m not sure how this can be when I also have a MicoCell.  5-installation) You must install your Chime before your Doorbell to lessen any installation problems.  The one thing I like is you don't have to ring the doorbell to know someone or something is at your door.  The FedEx women just waved her hand in front of the doorbell and Chime informed me.\",\n",
       " 'Loved the idea of this.  I bought the ring doorbell and 2 chimes.  It worked some of the time but dropped more often than it worked.  Initially, it appeared it was my network but after spending 1800.00 with a professional and getting my network in A+ form - it worked for less than a week.  Next my transformer on my wired doorbell went out.  I have tried all their troubleshooting tips and reinstalled, reset, and done headstands trying to keep this up and running.  I can do the whole sequence in my sleep.I give up.  When I told them I give up and want to return it (or maybe they could have offered me a new one as a replacement, they said I couldreturn if it was purchased in their website.So beware - they offer it in Home Depot or Amazon but hey only accessory returns if it was purchased on their website.-my initial review ----We ordered this after there was a burglary in the neighborhood.

       " \"Others have reported similar experience to mine so I will be brief.PROS:Setup was pretty simple.  I appreciate the fact that the doorbell lets you know when it needs to be charged.CONS:Motion detection sensitivity is a joke.  As far as I have been able to tell you have a choice of sensing every vehicle that drives down the street or just big trucks or fast cars.  A lot of days it does not even detect the mail carrier who has to walk right up to it.  I would say more often than not, it fails to detect my wife or me entering the house, and anyone entering the house or leaving despite the fact that you practically brush it with your shoulder.The motion detector setting in the app is a bit of a joke, too.  You use a little slide scale that is difficult to get to move, and you only have a graphic suggestion of distance so you don't really know what the setting is.Motion detection is way too slow to respond.  Even when it does respond to someone like a UPS person, you get a video of them walking away.Live View is hit or miss.  Occasionally I have actually seen the live image, but for a few days now it has shown nothing, ie, nothing happens when you tap the Live View play icon.  It might start working again tomorrow.  Who knows?I did not have an opportunity to install mine until a couple of months after I purchased it.  Within a couple of weeks I realized it was pretty useless, but it was obviously too late to return to Amazon.The simple doorbell I had before was at least good at it's job.\",\n",
       " \"I purchased this for my new home. I had done a lot of research and felt a wired doorbell would work great in our situation. After installation we noticed terrible connectivity issues and poor video quality. I worked with support and decided to purchase the Ring Chime Pro - it's wireless extender and chime. It still didn't work. Because my wireless network works great and even after we added the Chime Pro it was still not working.I worked with Ring support to replace the current model and upgrade to the Ring 2 (the upgraded 1080p one). I thought this one might work better - I even paid the difference of 20 dollars for the upgraded model. The Ring 2 Doorbell arrived, after installation the video at night was terrible and had lines streaming all over when it was on in the evening. After calling support - they said it was a hardware issue and sent another replacement. The Ring 2 replacement arrived - the video looks great, but often cannot connect and show live view. I have done the work in making sure it has a good wifi signal, it's wired, firmware is upgraded etc... just a really bad run. Support is always helpful and pleasant - it's the product that is just terrible quality and bad performance.\",\n",
       " 'Update: After several problems with my three original Ring Video Doorbells. Ring customer service replaced them with two Ring Video Doorbell 2\\'s and a Ring Spotlight Cam (Wired). After two weeks of use I can say there is a lot of improvement. The Spotlight Cam is great. I have no problems with it what so ever. However, there was a couple of issues with the Ring Doorbell 2. I was able to resolve them. For some reason my Google WiFi would lose connection to the doorbells just like with the original doorbells, only this time the doorbells showed connected in the ring app. Google WiFi just showed \"No Data\" for the doorbells. I tried the chime pro again, which was awful the connections speeds were bad for both and just wasn\\'t a good solution. What I finally did to make it work was pull my old 2.4 GHz WiFi router out of the closet. I set up the router as an AP by turning off DHCP, and connecting the router from a switch connected to one of my Google WiFi Hubs and a LAN port on the router (Not the WAN). I gave the network a different SSID and password and connected my doorbells to this AP (Ring products do not have to be on the same SSID or the same WiFi, the app takes care of that). Since I done this there are no connection issues at all with the doorbells. I tried this same setup with the original Ring doorbells, but it still had issues. So I finally have doorbells that work.Update: I was once again contacted by a Ring neighborhood advocate. We are currently working to resolve my issues. They have taken steps in the right direction, but we are not there yet. I’ve been promised a resolution by the end of next week regarding the issues with my Doorbell’s. I’ve had the ring doorbell installed since late April, and have issues all the time. I’ve have 3 Ring Doorbells and a stick up cam installed. I have had nothing but trouble with all of them. They lose connection to the network constantly even though the router (mesh) is only a few feet away from the doorbell. Live view barely ever works. I have missed several rings where the data isn’t being sent to my devices. Recordings are black so if someone was at my door trying to get in I would have no record of it. If it wasn’t past my 30 days I’d return this Setup go with regular doorbells and cameras.',\n",
       " \"We have had the Ring doorbell for almost a year now and we are thinking of getting something else.  Seems that ever since Amazon bought out Ring, we have had nothing but problems with our doorbell.  Installation was easy, we hardwired it directly to our existing doorbell.Here are the pros:Video for the most part is clearVoice is loud for person at door, a little more difficult to hear on phone for person answeringDoorbell is nice in appearance and has a nice chime when rungEasy to installApp is adequate/easy to useHere are the cons:Motion area is a joke at best.  When you have it set out far, every car that drives on our street triggers the motion, but it won't record a person walking up to the door until they are already standing there for a few minutes!  When you set the range to less, you still get cars (but coming from only one side of the road, not both), but someone walking to your door is not recorded until they are standing right at your door!Seems like video/motion has a severe delay.  Example:  Every time someone comes to the door, say UPS/FedEx, they walk up to the door, scan and drop the package, turn and walk back to the truck.  The video will start recording when they are leaning down to place package on step and then walking away!  If someone were actually stealing my package, all I would get is their back as they walked away!!!!  Defeats the purpose of the video!  (and since we pay to have the cloud storage, this is upsetting)When someone rings the doorbell, it takes a minute for the screen to load (this could be in part due to our internet), but even if I am in the house, right by the router, it takes such a delay to show and the person who rang the bell has been standing there for like a minute before you can even see who it is or acknowledge them.  Yes, a minute isn't a big deal. . .takes that and longer for someone to actually walk to the door and answer it. But just count to 60 and it is long enough.  The video and playback should not take that long!!!If you live in cold climates, don't expect it to work when it is subzero.  We had about a week during winter where there was a cold snap and our Ring app kept saying our battery was low (even though it is hardwired to our existing doorbell) and would not work.Overall, I am not happy with this product.  There is no reason someone walking up the pathway (which is relatively straight) shouldn't trigger the motion as they are walking up and not when they are at the door. . . but will trigger motion when a car (which is like 10 feet away) drives by!\",\n",
       " \"I love the Ring doorbell but the speaker really is too low and the person ringing the doorbell cannot hear me. This causes frustration and well it plain sucks that I paid for a product that does not do what it advertises. I would not recommend this product. On top of all that they charge you $30 a year to keep the cloud service up not bad but it's worthless since you can't even communicate with the people at the door.4/8/2018 - Update: I got a new Ring doorbell from Ring. The problem persists and there is absolutely nothing that can be done. So far I’m out $220 and absolutely nothing to show for it. I do however have a great little camera on the front door that I can watch from anywhere.My official recommendation is to stay away from this product at all costs. I’m sure that the August doorbell may be better than this product or even one of the cheapest ones on Amazon will work a thousand times better.6/2/2018 - Update: so after a little over a month of troubleshooting the product with Ring we have come up with an answer to the low speaker problem. The app is not completely compatible with iOS. It works perfectly with Android but not a good fit with iOS. If you are not willing to get a new Android phone to replace your iPhone then steer clear of this product.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!\",\n",
       " 'THis review is for the Bronze $99 Ring product.Once you getting it working, it is a great addition to home security. I wanted to hard wire it as to alleviate taking off the base every few months and recharging. The directions stated that any wire could be attached to either terminal. The first try was a not go, so I swapped the wires and viola, the doorbell wires started powering the unit. So, if it does not work as far as charging the first wiring, then try swapping the wires on the unit and see if that does the trick.Another installation issue had to do with wifi connection. The signal was too weak. I simply re-positioned the modem closer and it worked. If fact, it helped with ALL of the wifi connections in the house, so it was a good thing in the end.The sensitivity of the motion detection is great and somewhat over reactive as it picks up every car that drives past our house on the street. There is an adjustment in the app, yet if I were to bring the zones in more I would sacrifice the side detection that I want on the driveway, so I manage.The night detection could be improved. It is grainy due to my overlighting of the front house.The live feed is awesome and the audio interaction between the person at the door talking to one another via my phone and the Ring doorbell works great! I really like that feature. I tell a lot of people to \"GET OFF MY LAWN!\" and they love it.I opted for the $30 annual RING subscription with one month free so that all my videos are stored on their cloud.Overall, I am very pleased with this product. I would like them to tweek the coverage areas to be more versatile and bring the cloud storage fees down to maybe $12 a year instead.',\n",
       " 'After two days with support at Ring it is clear that this product is a dud.  I was really excited to receive this, and bought the Chime to go with it.Well, if the sole purpose of this product is to let you know who is at your door or gate and to let you communicate with that person it is a total failure.  And if I have to answer one more question from tech support about where my router is positioned (in my tiny house) in respect to the doorbell as if that was the obvious answer to all the problems with this product and not a problem with the product itself...my head might just explode.  First, the quality of the video is horrendous (see picture).  It reminds me of old video tape after 10 generations of duplication. Second, night vision...what night vision? I have a camera in my yard that switches to night vision when it gets dark (way way cheaper than this paperweight) so I know what it\\'s suppose to look like.  The video switches to black and white and very clear.  I\\'d left the still uninstalled doorbell in the living room last night and it got activated by something...maybe my dog.  So I looked at my phone and my iPad to see how the night vision was working.  Uh...total blackness, except for a speck of reflective light so I knew it was on and working.  So I thought maybe it needed a little light to work so I went down and turned on a couple of lights.  Nope..no night vision...just the low light affect of a room in a red ambient glow.  I stepped up to the camera to see if my face would b discernible in this non night vision low light but my face was but a blob.  Would show you a screengrab of that from the saved video but tech support had me uninstall the app from my device and then couldn\\'t get connected again so can\\'t access account.  So aside from horrible quality picture, and no night vision as it claims to have, the doorbell camera end of it would not receive audio when I answered the ring.  I tried talking to the \"visitor\" using both my android phone and my iPad and he could not hear me, although I could hear him.  And to cap it all off, while testing the device as my friend was about to install it outside, it would freeze up and we had to wait a few minutes before being able to ring doorbell again.  Don\\'t think my visitors would appreciate that much...or package delivery.  Tech support didn\\'t really have any answers.  We checked the upload speed when the devices froze presumably trying to upload or access videos, which he said was fine.  Everything else internet wise and speed wa fine too.  This is not cutting edge technology.  It\\'s pretty basic nowadays so no excuse for it to be so low quality and so ineffective.  So yeah...I will be returning this which has taken up way to much time that I can never get back.  An expensive paperweight for sure.',\n",

Took off the old doorbell button and installed this thing in less than 10 minutes. I actually had to install it on the molding around the door frame and it still looks great.  All you do is connect the 2 wires to the 2 screws on the mounting plate and attach it to the wall.  Once installed simply setup your account and user settings and let the fun begin.

       " 'It\\'s unreliable and slow.  I\\'m still debating whether its worth the cost of keeping it.1.  The most critical issue is that the motion detection is extremely unreliable.  Twice in the last 2 weeks we\\'ve had a package delivered but received no video and no notification.  What\\'s the point of a motion-activated video camera if motion does not always activate it?  I\\'ve adjusted motion settings several times, and on the current settings it works most of the time.  For this price it should work ALL of the time.  Even worse, when I awoke this morning I had a notification of motion at the front door in the middle of the night; however, NO VIDEO in the log.  FAIL2.  I have the doorbell plus 2 cameras, all activated on a different day.  So, the annual plan took effect on a different day for each one.  They helped me with that by automatically consolidating the bill once each took effect, charging me $90 in the end for all 3.  However, they\\'re keeping the $60 (minus what I assume to be prorated daily charge) I paid as the first two plans went active and promising to apply to next year\\'s bill.  I\\'m not sure why they don\\'t simply refund that money, but what also concerns me is that my on-line account at Ring.com doesn\\'t reflect any credit in my account.  I guess they expect us to simply trust them.3.  There\\'s a big latency between pressing the button on the doorbell and hearing the chime or getting the video.  Like others, many of my videos are of people\\'s backsides.4.  Even though I have scheduled periods during which I don\\'t want motion notifications, each still records a video every time it detects motion.  This is wasteful and lame.  So, I\\'m in the habit of clearing out all the videos every now and then.5.  It\\'s nowhere near \"crystal-clear HD video\" as stated on their Amazon product listing.  It appears to be 720p but compressed, so not at all \"crystal clear.\"',\n",
       " 'Got it from Amazon warehouse deal so saved 40% off new - good thing because it\\'s not worth the full price (in my opinion). First thing you need to do is download the Ring app to your supported device and follow the simple instructions that comes with the unit. Wait half an hour for the firmware to update (that\\'s if your internet connection is good enough). By the way, if the wifi test shows the signal is too weak at your installation location, return the unit, it\\'ll do you no good. Best if you use \"wired\" connection using your existing doorbell. That way the unit battery continuously charges (very slowly) and have to worry less about the unit battery discharging too quickly. Recharging the battery is a hassle if not \"wired\" as the main unit need to be removed and connected to a power source using the included usb cable (a poor design). Wall mount the real panel using the supplied screws and the screw driver taking care to not overtighten as to warp the panel. This is very important as slight warp will prevent good electrical contact with the main unit and the \"wired connection\" will not be recognized ( problem I sorted thru). Camera is, at best, adequate with a round fish eye view of the world and poor resolution. Furthermore, the view is too wide, you\\'re standing 4 feet from the camera and it shows the whole body so the most important part, the FACE, is TINY. It\\'s not like I need a camera that takes in the whole front yard and the street, dahh..., you would think the manufacturer would be a lot smarter than this.  As far as I can see, setting  zones does very little in the overall view area. The motion sensor and video capture timeframe is slow and all the negative comments about video coming on too late is legit. Video is jerky with ghosting problems associated with slow connection to the internet. What would really make it much more useful is a snapshot feature where it captures photo shots at 10 second increments. This will amount to about four snaps per incident and Ring can store that in their cloud storage and offer it for free up to 7 days. Otherwise, after the trial period, you get NO video storage at all.  Whether this product can serve as a security camera is highly debatable and my assessment is a big NO. It serves as a method of seeing who\\'s at the door and telling sales or religious zealots to scram. Want real security features - get a decent security camera that doesn\\'t cost a whole lot more. At least Ring now offers a one year complimentary video storage and notification service so I don\\'t immediately have to decide whether subscription is worth it. I\\'ll probably bundle this with the Ring home security system I\\'m getting then it\\'ll be part of the $10 monthly plan.

       " 'I purchased this doorbell because I don’t live in the best of areas and from our front door there’s no way you can see who is at the door without opening the door to see. I decided to get this for a more security feeling. The box came really nice almost like an iPhone, it had easy instructions on installation and came with all the tools. It was a little tricky to install we had to drill pretty big holes into the bricks of the house but I guess that’s what we gotta do to put it up. So the camera quality isn’t the best but it’s not the worst. It’s almsot like when you’re watching a 440 quality YouTube video and it’s all pixalated and hard to see that’s what the camera reminds me off but it gets the job done. A few of the cons for me is that the battery doesn’t last that long I have to charge the doorbell at least once a week maybe two max I thought I read online somewhere that the battery is supposed to last six months. I live in front of a busy street I’ve tried multiple times to adjust the zones for the doorbell not to detect cars I’ve literally set it to like five feet even though I would like to see if someone is in the yard as well it still catches almsot every. Single. Car. My phone is constantly going off and I check back the video it was just a car. That may be the reason for the battery being drained. My other con with the doorbell is that it stops recording even if there is still motion at the front door. The videos that are recorded are about 20/30 seconds long and even if someone is in the front yard or standing by the front door it’ll stop recording and that frustrates me so much because one day if something sketchy does happen I won’t have video proof because the doorbell only records for like 20 seconds.  I do like the app I like how I can see crimes that happened in my area and people share videos of suspicious activity around their house which is really neat. The app has a lot of features and sometimes the camera takes a long time to load when I want to look outside but it’s just an average doorbell. It does what it says it’s going to do and I’m still going to keep it and use it.',\n",

I believe that the design of the doorbell is as follows and is flawed.  When the doorbell is pressed the video is streamed to Ring server initially before the phone app can access the video stream. Once it is streaming the phone app is accessing the video steam from Ring server.  I can only assume the latency or can’t connect to doorbell is connect issue to video stream on Ring server since I know my local network (1000 Mbps hubs and new wireless access points as well 100 Mbps internet) is not the issue.  I originally thought the POE Wired $500 Ring Elite was way to go but people who bought that version are having same issue.  I had a hard time paying $500 for a video doorbell even if it had no latency.  If there was some other solution similar to Ring I would be doing it.  Currently looking at adding door dome camera with speaker and microphone to my Amcrest surveillance system.  Not a nice integrated solution to Ring but at least I can get video and audio. In this scenario the Ring is a $99 door chime.',\n",

       " \"Please let me say first that Ring USA customer service is among the best I have ever encountered. Seriously. I really hope Ring doesn't outsource it to New Delhi. So...I've been experiencing motion detection problems since I installed it. It's not all Ring's fault. As you can see from the photo the Ring, replacing the digital doorbell under the light, is in a tough location for its design. When I called customer service I was told that Zone 1 was activated on their screen, yet on all my three devices with the mobile app, only Zone 6 was activated. Consequently, I am getting almost constant notifications when a vehicle passes by, about 35 feet away. Even though I set it to Zone 6 (six feet), hit save, ring the Ring, it doesn't seem to be saving the change. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. I don't want to do a factory reset. Otherwise, the video quality at 780p is just fine. There is a slight delay from when the device picks up motion close to the porch. The Ring is hard wired to existing doorbell wiring, which I prefer over moving the location on relying on the battery. If your location is what Ring recommends, I recommend this device. It really is easy to install and set up. Many companies could do well to copy Ring's customer service - theirs and Nordstrom (although Ring doesn't seem to answer emails).\",\n",

Unfortunately, full support for this integration is currently unavailable for Ring Video Doorbell and Stick Up Cam.Ring Video Doorbell 2, Video Doorbell Pro, Video Doorbell Elite and Floodlight Cam are supported, although there are limitations. For these devices, you will be able to access Live View and direct your Ring device(s) with voice commands, as well as watch live videos from them on your Echo Show.Please note that you cannot talk to your visitors using Alexa on the Echo Show, however you are able to listen to audio from your Ring devices.Click here to learn more about the Ring integration with Amazon Echo Show.We are excited about this new integration and can’t wait to introduce features that let you get the most out of Ring. As soon as further updates are available, you’ll be the first to know.Thanks for your support,The Ring TeamThen I did a chat to verify this information.  I had TWO Ring customer service people tell me on their chat that it is compatible.  One kept saying it was even after sending her the text of the email.  I am so sick of this company.  Problem is though - what is something worth buying?  Ring can\\'t be the only game in town.As of today, all my Ring videos is the person leaving.  They will have you troubleshoot and troubleshoot by pressing the reset button or re-installing the app.  Already done, Ring.  MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE PROBLEM (WHICH YOU DENY) STILL EXISTS. Just like other issues in the past that you denied then magically were fixed with an update.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTExcuses, excuses.  The firmware is screwed up and Ring admits it!  They have no ETA to get it fixed. It is \"something they are working on.\"  On the phone with Ring right now. Even told me if they replace the unit, the problem will still exist!  Asking for a full refund from them and all Ring users should do the same. It is sad that a good idea has been screwed up by incompetent owners and developers. And to help others, my problems were all old video motions back (with no ETA TO FIX) and horrible glare on my motions. Just hung up the phone.

       " \"I initially wrote a negative review because I couldn't get it to work and I couldn't get in touch with technical support.  They saw my review and reached out to me.  The problem was that my network has spaces in the name and the Ring doesn't like that in the initial setup. Support suggested starting the setup using a hotspot on my phone, then switching back to my home network.  This worked.  The doorbell is now mounted and being powered by my original doorbell wiring.  Now that I've used it awhile, here is an update.One really nice thing is that the package comes with everything you need to mount the doorbell, except a power drill.  The drill bit, screws, anchors and even a level are in the package.The night vision works quite well.  I'm including a photo.  In fact, the image is better than the day mode.The resolution is barely adequate and I'd recommend getting a higher resolution.  I've seen them side by side and the 1080 version is worth the investment, in my opinion.The Ring is completely reliable at detecting motion.  I had to set the sensitivity to medium because it was picking up cars on the street, more than 50 feet away.  Now it only detects motion that is closer.There are a couple of issues.  There is a several second delay between the time it detects motion and when it starts recording. If UPS just drops a package, I only have video of him walking away, as pictured.  He'd already dropped the package and was leaving before the recording started.  If he stands on the porch and scans the package there, I will get video of the front of him.  Note also, that with the scene being back lit, all the detail from the man is too dark to see.  Nearly everyone's porch will be back lit and I see no adjustment to compensate for this.  I'd rather have the background washed out and the foreground visible.  When someone stands very close to the Ring, their face is visible but pixelated.  This is another reason to purchase a higher definition model.I looked at reviews of several competitor's products and these seem to be common issues with all of them.  From what I've read, it seems like the Ring is the one that has the least delay.In short, yes, I'd recommend this product.  I don't think you can do better for $99.95.Personally, I've got a friend that wants this 720 resolution one and I'm passing it on and buying a higher resolution video doorbell.\",\n",

By the time the app pulls up, it connects and the video is visible, the truck is halfway back out of the driveway.  Absolutely useless for what it is supposed to be able to do.  I think maybe you might be able to catch an angry neighbor at the door if they wait long enough to bitch you out for you dog digging up his yard.

My attempts to get adequate technical support have proven a failure as the people on their tech sites have, to date, only been able to walk me through the simple setup procedure - they are not technical orientated. That said I would say that this is a non-real time system and its dependency on the provided cell phone software and the internet dependency makes this unit a poor choice as a reliable doorbell system.

Thus, when someone pushes the Ring, my interior doorbell rings and keeps ringing without stopping.  Kind of hard to live with that!2.  The delay in motion activation is substantial.

       " 'I\\'ve had my ring 1 week now while I worked from home so I could do a solid evaluation.  Bottom line, inconsistent motion detection.  Just for example, I had two packages delivered today, both left within a foot of the doorbell and neither delivery men were detected, yet when the garbage truck drove by on the street (30 feet away and out side my \"detection zone\\') it recorded that!  It doesn\\'t detect the mailman - most of the time, nor neighbors cars as they drive by - most of the time (my range is set to about 15\\'), but it did detect a gecko climbing on the brick next to the door bell.In short, its simply unreliable, especially for the cost.  Great concept, poorly executed!Edit:  Within a day after posting this review, Ring contacted me asking if I would give them an opportunity to make my purchase right.  I agreed and a call was set up for the next day I was home in order to troubleshoot.  I was assigned a neighborhood advocate or something like that and over the phone we attempted a few fixes.  By the end of this, she had expedited an order for me that included a Ring 2 doorbell, a wifi extender chime and a wedge kit.It was a week later that I had the chance to install the new device and begin testing it.  At first, disappointment did not abate as response was very slow.  I tried several configurations with and without the wifi extender (my router is very close to my front door) and I also used the 5 degree down wedge to reduce alerts from cars on the road.  Of greatest disappointment was there was no two way communication between my phone and the doorbell.  I was gone again the following week and while I did get alerts, there was rarely anything there.  On Tuesday, my landscaper arrived to do some work and it picked up the motion, but still no sound.  Then the very next day there was suddenly sound.  Wasn\\'t sure it was two way, but at least i could hear and it recorded sound from the doorbell.I returned home on Thursday night and tested the sound and there was two way communication.  I had left with the wifi extender not in the mix, but on Friday I decided to try again with the extender.  I was able easily to reconfigure the setup and to my delight I still had two way communication.  I have tested it throughout the weekend and it seems to be working fine.  I even had a delivery Friday that was picked up by the doorbell.  With the Ring 2, the video quality is much better than the Ring.I will say that Ring did make a strong effort to correct the issue.  I have upgraded my rating from two stars to 4, primarily due to their customer service effort.  The doorbell is working now although I\\'m not sure why two way communication suddenly began to work - perhaps a firmware update?  I can\\'t say I have total confidence in the device, but will continue to monitor and when I do, I will update this review.',\n",

       " 'It was supposed to just replace my old bell button and work with my existing doorbell. Sure, there were setup videos, and even a snarky statement during wifi setup that \"Rome wasn\\'t built in a day\" but nonetheless it wasn\\'t super clear what setup to use with my mechanical doorbell and what they suggested still doesn\\'t work.My mechanical doorbell buzzed non-stop trying to go \"the mechanical route\" so I went the with diode setup. Things seemed okay initially (it stopped the buzzing), but the transformer eventually fried and, over time, the battery of the ring doorbell as well.This resulted in some embarrassing / frustrating misses of a service call, a food delivery, and having our babysitter standing there for 10 minutes while we started to fret our appointment having no idea ever that the doorbell just wasn\\'t working.Ok, color me an early adopter to smart home setup, I guess that\\'s par for the course with a \"smart\" wifi based device, but given the following facts I don\\'t think it\\'s worth the risk to give Ring your $$.- Ring relies on your wifi, if there are issues with connectivity, it doesn\\'t work- Ring relies on their cloud service for seeing activity of missed calls, you have to pay $$ to see activity you miss by subscribing to their cloud service after 30 days of \"free\" usage- Ring (at least my generation) didn\\'t let you spontaneously view the camera or listen to the outside, this was later \"fixed\" with app updates- There is a pretty substantial time lag between events and when you are notified- The bell itself rings loudly giving the impression that something is happening, this is also audible by your neighbors, ok fine, but when you don\\'t hear anything in the house, and your guest thinks they\\'re being heard they will patiently wait and wonder before calling you.We purchased the chime extender because we couldn\\'t rely on the door-bell, and while it\\'s cool that it notifies you when there is motion, it\\'s not the best wifi device and frequently loses connection. One sucky tidbit there is that the chime doesn\\'t come with the advertised international adapters it says it does..we wen\\'t through several returns before we realized that ring is basically not giving those away with the device.In short, when someone is at the door, you pretty much want to know instantly, and if there is activity going on outside you want the option to use the camera you purchased without waiting for it to trigger motion or call you, and if stuff did happen, they basically hold your footage hostage in a monthly cost model.Ring has taught me that the smart home market is basically flooded with not-so-great products. Just because they were new to market or offer wifi doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a great idea. In my case I basically spent a lot of money to break something already pretty reliably and be consistently annoyed by it\\'s lack of quality and service.',\n",

Many transformers, including ours, only put out 10 to 12 volts which IS NOT enough.If you install the Ring and Device Health  does not show 'Hardwired', it is not charging the battery and will quit functioning when the battery runs down.

       " 'I am a security addict.  There, I said it.  I have worked at a major international airport in the security field (NOT TSA).  What I know from my experience is that you really need to stop people from coming into your secured zone.  The last thing that you want to do is have to confront them after they have already accessed it.  You need to convince evil doers that the last thing that they want to do is to break into your house or trespass on your property.  So, what works best?  An armed security guard is best.  However, few can afford that.  A dog?  Maybe, but are you willing to provide the constant training that a protection dog needs?  Not many do. However, just having a loud barking dog will dissuade most bad guys from even thinking about coming into your home.  So, if you can\\'t afford a security guard, you are allergic or afraid of dogs, what do you do?  Get alarms, cameras and big signs announcing their presence. \"Most\" burglars do not want to deal with any security because \"most\" burglars have neither the desire or intelligence to do so.  They are opportunists.  They break into your home because it is there and available.  I have numerous methods employed around my home that are effective.Recently, I decided to try the RING doorbell.  I am very glad that I did.  I got it for a great price during Amazon\\'s thanksgiving sale.  It has worked flawlessly since being installed.  Installation, by the way, is extremely easy.  If you know where your old doorbell is and know how to twist a screwdriver, then you can install this doorbell.  It IS that easy.  Then you connect it to the APP and you are done.  I have had lots of opportunity to test it since installation.  With Christmas coming I have had a lot of packages delivered.  It instantly identified every delivery person coming to my door and then alerted me within a second or two.  Then I am able to review clear video of whatever is, or was, at the door.  It has never failed to alert me of someone\\'s presence.  (Having a large German Shepherd dog barking in the background doesn\\'t hurt either.)  There are a multitude of uses for this camera.  You don\\'t need to have only one.  I can see myself installing them at every door.Now the problems with RING.  -They are rather expensive.  The going price is about $179-$199 for the standard model.  Costco has the doorbell packaged with the optional chime for $179.  The pro model is $20 more.  Discounts are few and far between.  I got mine for $129 during Black Friday.  - RING wants you to subscribe to their \"cloud\" service in order to store the videos. This is an extra expense that is not necessary.  Most people have access to a free cloud storage service already.  Paying RING is just a company trying to produce additional revenue.  - An article in CNET said that RING was vulnerable to hackers trying to access your WIFI, etc. The hacker would have to physically take the RING doorbell off the wall that it was on and use the orange button on the back to hack into it.  RING has supposedly fixed this issue.  The hacker would have one big problem though;  while he was taking the device off the wall, it would be taking video of him doing so and alerting you and sending video to storage.I have a rather extensive home automation system with alarms.  I have a very loud german shepherd dog.  I have signs on my lawn and windows.  I have other cameras.  But my favorite of all of them is the RING doorbell.  And NO, I don\\'t work for the company and NO, I didn\\'t receive this product for free.  I just like to share my professional opinion when I find a good product.',\n",
       " 'I installed a Ring doorbell as part of adding SmartHome devices to my house. Let me say right off that the only Amazon Echo device the Ring works with is the Echo Show (e.g., \"Alexa, show the Front Door\"), and that\\'s pretty cool. Ring includes a nice installation package with the doorbell, including screwdriver, level, mounting screws, screw anchors, and even a masonry drill bit for brick or stucco siding. My old doorbell was installed when the house was built in 1973. I have wood siding at the front door and my doorbell uses a 20V (AC) transformer, so my installation went exactly like the Ring instruction video. Apparently most doorbells use low voltage AC produced by a simple transformer wired into a house circuit. For a wired installation Ring requires the transformer produce between 8VAC and 24VAC. My transformer is located in the attic so it was easy to check its VAC rating, but if you have a volt meter you can simply use its VAC setting to check the wires at the push button connection. Newer doorbells may be digital, so Ring supplies a diode to wire across the contacts to handle that scenario. If the Ring is installed as a battery powered device, you have to have your smart phone on hand to notify you when someone is at the door.Setup can only be done with the Ring removed from its bracket and running off of its internal battery. It also requires you to be online using Ring\\'s smart phone app. The setup is easy and you can quickly verify functionality. Once installed on the bracket, press the Ring\\'s button and your inside chime sounds plus the Ring makes a chime sound itself. After that you will probably do what I did and figure out what else it can do, which is where things get a bit annoying since the documentation for the app is a bit buried on Ring\\'s rather annoying website. The doorbell actually runs off of its internal battery, which can be charged via USB, and which for a wired connection recharges (slowly) from the VAC source. Heavy usage will draw the battery down faster than it will recharge, requiring you to remove the Ring from its bracket to recharge the battery externally (the software will warn you when the battery is too low).From my perspective, sound quality is marginal and video is good, although the camera is easily fooled by lighting contrasts. As a doorbell device performance is excellent, for surveillance, less so. With the fish-eye lens you get great coverage, but with the distortion might have trouble making identification after the fact. The motion detection uses IR and is a bit slow on the uptake, where recording may not start until someone approaching the house has been in range a few seconds (possibly missing them entirely). As delivered, my Ring would only activate by the doorbell or motion sensing, but once I updated the firmware, live view worked, enabling the app to view the camera on demand. It took some hunting around to find out how to get the firmware updated, which turns out to be simple (in the Ring app, in the live view settings you just activate, then deactivate live view, which triggers an update check).I might have given this a 5 star rating if there was some way to capture video other than relying on Ring\\'s rather expensive cloud service ($30 per year, a lot considering that they only hold your video for 60 days). At least the company seems to be responsive to its customers, as evidenced by continuing to provide firmware upgrades for nice to have features like live view and Echo Show.Update: I\\'ve had my unit installed for over a month and it\\'s doing fine. As for the Echo Show, you can only access live view, not answer the doorbell, something Ring acknowledges on their web site. That\\'s is a major mis-hit on Ring\\'s part, or perhaps it is a case of the Show\\'s software being too beta to be able to adequately deal with a device like the Ring at this time. I decided to pony up for Ring\\'s cloud service to be able to check the doorbell when away from home. That generally works, but I\\'ve found the motion detection is often too slow to react to a delivery person in a hurry (either failing to record anything, or recording their receding backside). Also, on some occasions the camera image is simply black (in broad daylight conditions), which may be a function of my Comcast internet service dropping out at random times during the day.  All in all I remain positive about the product and see no reason to change my rating.Update 2: I\\'ve now had my ring doorbell for over a year and it continues to work well. Performance has actually improved since I put in a Google mesh system to distribute wi-fi throughout my house, ditching a hodge-podge of range extenders that went South with every power interruption. The Ring was particularly useful when we had to vacate the house for 4 months this Spring due to hurricane related repairs (fortunately the power could remain on).  With the ring outside and a couple of cameras inside I was able to effectively monitor the house and work progress. The Ring activated whenever crews came to the door, and enabled me to run off a guy nosing around who was not a subcontractor. That alone justified the price of the Ring. Live view also enabled me to determine things like rain and wind conditions. Most cars don\\'t trigger mine, but large trucks usually do (it\\'s about 70\\' to the street) . The only real complaint I have is that detected motion does not activate the device soon enough, plus the delay of getting through the cell network is likely to preclude effectively answering the door bell.',\n",
       " 'I read reviews on here about the Ring and really didn’t know if I wanted it because a lot of people complained about it. So I’m now giving my two cents for those of you who might be experiencing the same thing.PROS: it’s inexpensive for peace of mind at home and away. People complained that you have to pay to save your videos but it’s only $3 a month which is an extremely small amount of money considering what you would pay for other security subscriptions. The sound is pretty good on it, I can hear things on the street in front of my house. Most of my pros are what you might expect - it does it’s job and offers me peace of mind when I’m at work. I see packages delivered, who comes to my door, and sometimes I’ll watch the live feed just to see what my street is up to.CONS: sometimes I’ll hear something outside my house or get a motion alert and I’ll hurry up and open the Ring app to view it but it takes forever bringing up the video feed. After months of use, it’s still one of my least favorite things. It’s also got a movement delay even though the sensitivity is all the way up. We will catch the mailman walking away from the porch but not to it. Finally, I hate having to take it down to charge it but that’s what happens when you buy the earlier version because you want to save money.All in all: I couldn’t live without my Ring. It was $99 well spent and I don’t regret it. I also want to add that I had to get two plastic pieces for mine that are sold separately, to mount mine at an angle. Just be prepared that it might need to be mounted at an angle at your house too. Also, don’t try to put it inside of a storm door thinking that will keep it from being stolen - it reads heat signature which it can’t detect from behind glass. It’ll have to be mounted outside outside. I’ve been told that if a thief does steal it, you just need to provide a police report to Ring and they’ll replace it free of charge.',\n",
       " \"After having some minor vandlelism I deceided to install a security camera. It had to meet the following requirements:1.  Preferably battery powered with long battery life, in case I wanted to relocate later, with easy set up.2.  Great video especially in night IR mode, at a distance of at least 30'.3.  Video saved to the cloud instead of a memory card/hard drive, in case it's stolen or destroyed. Videos must also be downloadable in case I need to provide to police/insurance.4.  WiFi connectivity to my Android & iOS devices so it could alert me not only while home or away but others as well.5.  Combined both IR & motion detection to eliminate false movement of our 2 flags.The Ring meets all of the above except #1* & #2 above.  In addition its a door bell.  An added benefit is free replacement of the unit if it's stolen. I'm not sure if that includes damage by vandals/burgulars.The battery is a built in rechargeable and Ring claims about 1 year life between recharges via its micro USB port. (Update: after 30 days my Ring's battery was down to 10% & needed to be recharged. So much for 1 year battery life.) Installation took just a few minutes to drill 4 holes to attach the backplate. Ring slides on to the backplate and is held in place with 2 hex screws on the bottom. Ring even includes a concrete drill bit, screws & screw drivers, however it does not include a drill bit for mounting to wood/metal. WiFi setup was very easy taking just a few minutes.Ring includes free 30 day cloud storage. After that it cost only $30 for a year of cloud storage. Videos can be retrieved for up to 6 months & can easily be download. I wish it was free like my Piper NT camera I use inside our house, but $30/year is reasonable.Apps are available for both Android & iOS devices. I prefer the app on my iPad over the Android app on my cell phone, because I can delete notices easier & see full screen video on the iPad. While I can view notices anywhere I have an Internet connection it takes about 30 seconds between the notice & its ability to see the video (guess it has to wait for the video to be stored to the cloud.). You can also share notices with others, example: you're on vacation so family can react in your absence.It uses dual IR & motion to prevent false notices. Our 2 flags flopping in the breeze do not set it off because while moving it has no heat. It is only set off if the moving item has a heat signature.Cons: Video quality is not adjustable like my Piper NT. Quality is good if someone is standing in front of the Ring during daylight but loses quality the farther away the subject is, especially off to the side. Ring claims it has a wide angle lens but based on objects I can see on both sides I'd estimate it's about a 160-170 degrees not 180 degree like my Piper NT.  Ring uses a poor quality fish eye lens which distorts videos off to the sides. The IR night time video quality is marginal as is the distance it can see subjects. The battery life is not even close to the 1 year claimed, mine is only 30 days.Ring has 5 zones of detection which can be individually turn on or off. The detection range is adjustable out to 30'. Unfortunetly, I had to set the range to about 12' to prevent false detection of moving autos 50' out.Overall I'm happy with the Ring but would prefer they offered better video, especially night time. They could eliminate the expensive box & tools to use a better lens, etc.Update 10/24: submitted a suggestion to Ring to add remote viewing. In 20 minutes I had a reply thanking me for the great suggestion which they would pass on to their engineers. Wow...20 minutes...excellent service.\",\n",
       " \"This is actually the third unit I purchased. The first two I bought from Costco. I had (different) problems with both & tech support was unable to resolve. I returned both (kudos to Costco) but by then I had 4 holes drilled into my stucco for the Ring mounting plate, looks like crap.  FF about a year later and Amazon had a special on the bronze Ring so I decided to try it again. This time it seems to be working great, But...be aware that if you do not run this on WiFi only and leave cellular data turned on  (during the video recording trial period) this thing will blow thru your cellular data at an amazing rate (not an issue if you have an unlimited plan, I don't). I've asked to have the trial can which they said they'd take care of but it's still running, and eating data. Running it on Wifi is ok I guess provided you're never out of a WiFi hotspot when you leave the house and frankly that's not likely. And if it's only on WiFi how useful is it? I got it so I could monitor my front door and deliveries if I'm away from home.....which I can't do unless I'm tethered to a WiFi hotspot...........kinda useless in that case......jury is still out on whether or not I'll keep it..\",\n",
       " 'I bought this doorbell to fill a huge safety concern with our house. We live in a townhouse that has no windows near our door. Our door also doesn\\'t have a peep hole. These two things left us very vulnerable when opening our door to see who was knocking, or just leaving the house. After researching security doorbell cameras, I choose this one because it works with Amazon Alexa. We have a Dot, Echo, and an Echo Show.The Ring App is very useful and makes installing and setting up your doorbell camera very easy. The hardest part is trying to drill into brick to secure it beside our door. After this tedious task, the rest of the installation went very smoothly. One huge benefit to using this doorbell is that it has the option to be both wired (using your existing doorbell wiring) or wireless! This leaves the placement of this device totally up to you letting you choose the best coverage for overall security.As far as features go...this doorbell has a lot!First, there is a built in motion sensor calibration feature. This lets you setup your motion areas automatically or you can determine how sensitive the three designated motion zones are setup. This would be better if you can scale back an individual zone that might have a flag or a decoration that moves in the wind. As of now you only have the ability to turn off each zone, which does help but it\\'s not ideal to completely turn off a zone for obvious security reasons. The more expensive versions allow for these options, but it would still be nice to have this feature on the base model. You can also set motion \"sleep\" times that will turn off notifications for a set period of time. This is very useful when shoveling snow or kids playing in the front yard.Second, I love the fact that you get an alert on your phone whenever someone rings your doorbell, let alone walks up to your door. A simple tap on the alert takes you right to a live view of your doorbell camera allowing you to see, and either answer...or don\\'t answer whoever is at the door. Also, there is a live view setting which enables you to view your front door at any time regardless if there is someone there or not. This does lower the battery life when using with a wireless install, but honestly the battery lasts for quite some time.Fourth, there is a nice little feature that lets you upload events to the \"Ring Neighborhood\" which is a collection of Ring devices in the surrounding geographic areas. You can only see these events when a nearby neighbor shares and event with the community. This provides a greater security network, rather than having one camera you have an unknown number of cameras that can capture events and be shared with everyone so you know what to look out for. For example, one of my neighbors posted a couple bears digging through their trash in the early morning. Took extra precaution the next few weeks by viewing my front door before I left for work. I couldn\\'t imagine walking out and getting greeted by a hungry Yogi and Boo Boo without a picnic basket.Third, the battery lasts longer than expected. I bought this right before Christmas to make sure my Amazon gifts were delivered and didn\\'t go \"missing\" before I got home. The alerts from these deliveries, watching my son get on his bus, and the few alerts of random cars that pass our house per day seem to have a very little affect on how long the battery lasts. Charging this battery requires you take the whole doorbell off of the mount. This is done by loosing two little screws at the bottom of the doorbell. You do not need to take them out completely, which is what I did the first time and almost dropped them on the ground.Finally, and probably the biggest feature that my family and I use, is the integration with Amazon Alexa. After enabling the \"Ring Skill\" in the Alexa App, we are notified of any motion or pressing of the doorbell with a verbal notification on all our Alexa devices. This lets us know whenever someone is at our door, and on our Echo Show we can tell Alexa to show us the front door and she will bring up the live view.The only downfall that I was surprised with was that Ring needs a subscription to save your motion/doorbell events. It\\'s not much, I think around $37 for the year. You can still use your camera to see who is at your door or walking in front of your house, but after a free 30 day trial, your motion events are gone as soon as they are over. Since I bought it to make sure packages stayed on my stoop, I needed to be able to see if someone walked up and picked it up, or if it was even delivered at all. To be clear this is the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I like all the features and the ease of use. I would buy this camera again, but the upgraded model. This one records in 720p and the newer one is in 1080p which does make a difference as things get further away. Also the newer one comes with a \"Lifetime\" replacement if your Ring Doorbell is ever stolen (But I\\'m sure there\\'s some fine print in there somewhere). Taking this off the mount seems fairly easy, but with the videos going to the cloud and not being stored on the device itself can provide you with a video of this event. I hope this review helps...',\n",
       " \"This thing can be set super sensitive- where it will tell you when you're neighbor across the street checks his mail! Also has IR sensors so it works just as well at night with no porch lights. You can turn motion off and just be notified when someone presses the button. Battery is decent. We've had negative digit temperatures here in MI. The battery is lasting me around a month with very frequent- (5+ motion notifications a day!) Plus, it uses battery when you use the LIVE FEED feature.. when you want to see what's happening live outside your house. I use this frequently as well. Supposedly if I turned all of that off and only was notified when people rang the bell, the battery would last 10+ months! Or so they claim. Not so sure about that..But, the bracket makes it very easy to quickly take the Ring doorbell back inside for charging. Charging isn't quick (or slow).. if I had to guess I would say around 6-8 hours for a full charge. All in all, it does what I got it for.. notify me when Fedex/UPS bring packages that require signature. And for that, it's worth every penny.So far.\",\n",
       " 'Seemed to work for a day and then went out of range.  After replacing my router with a very powerful D-Link router I was able to get it to work slowly.  On its best day I could go to the door and deal with a visitor before the Ring video would even show up.  Device will not work with a computer only with iphone and app from app store.  A 30 day service to store videos was included with the device.  Ring would constantly push ads to get Ring Pro for another $100 further slowing down the performance.  Then the 30 day limit was approaching and Ring started pushing ads to start paying them a monthly fee before my trial expired, then it expired and so did the device.  I will keep it as a doorbell and the look may deter bad people but it is useless for a video device.  I really wanted to use it for Halloween trick or treaters I thought it would be fun.  It dropped dead on Halloween so the trick was on me, no fun.',\n",
       " 'This doorbell was hardwired and installed at Christmas. It gives me many false positives and also doesn’t pick up motion when someone moves quickly, like Amazon delivery persons.  Ring support was great!  They helped me with the adjustments.  I had to get wedge kits, but I think I’ll still pick up false motion because I get a lot of passing sunlight/clouds that cause the heat sensor to go off. It doesn’t happen at night or evenings. I may need the upgraded Ring that doesn’t use heat sensors.  It does give clear pictures!  I’m sorry I didn’t get the Ring 2 now, but I do like the security. (This is an updated review after I talked to support, Danielle,  at RING)Update:  it’s been almost a year. We’ve added the additional part that RING sent us, but had to remove it because it then angled the camera too much to the side. We hardly use it. I’ve turned off the sound because it goes off constantly. I do use it to check the History of motion sometimes. It could be just the way my front porch picks up shadows, but I think I’ll need to pay someone to just replace it being that I’m a senior citizen and I can’t do it.',\n",

Of course we don't notice right away so by the time we notice it we've gone days without it or a doorbell all together, which is not okay! The first time we had to unscrew it from the base and reinstall it....now it's offline even though our internet is working fine. FYI, if it's offline you not only lose video you don't have a working doorbell at all! Would not buy again! If we can't get a fix to this happening every few weeks we will be returning!Just got off the phone with Ring...even though the product is defective you can not return it for a refund....they want you to get on with tech support to troubleshoot, it's fixed for a few weeks and messed up again. What a waste of money, go with a different brand if you're looking for a video doorbell. Disappointed in the product and even more so with the lack of customer service!\",\n",
       " \"I bought this before traveling to Europe and installed it and got it to basically work within about 30 minutes. Nice.Silly me, I expected the camera interface to be like a DLINK or any other WiFi camera out there and thereby connect to my Blue Iris along with my 5 other cameras. Nowhere in there literature do they admit to this purposeful design.Here are the reasons I hate it.1. Marketing materials were not honest with me. No mention of incompatibility with standard video streaming.2. Proprietary video stream.3. IP address is not visible after installation.4. Changing to static IP after installation requires a complete reinstallation.5. Motion detection settings can only be saved by pushing the door bell button. (Not from Europe via the app as I needed)6. No pre-trigger video recording ability. (Blue Iris is great for this)7. The phone app does not allow for viewing or changing the configuration information or for naming the device for IP scanners.Ring should allow connection to real security software for a yearly fee. I for one won't pay for storing substandard video, triggered by rudimentary motion detection in their cloud.I bought the Ring to avoid wiring and mounting a real camera. My shortsighted mistake. I will replace it soon, and throw  in the garbage.\",\n",
       " 'I just purchased the 1st Gen Ring Doorbell through Amazon. I have this unit hardwired to our doorbell and connected to our wireless router.The ring doorbell is approximately 10 ft. from the router and shows a RSSI -40 signal strength. The Live view and recorded playback of Live view, motion detection, or an activated doorbell is subpar. I’ve attempted resetting both the Ring doorbell and my router, reconnected the devices and the quality didn’t improve. I’ve also brought the Ring doorbell inside and placed it next to the router and the image quality was degraded and laggy. What can Ring do to improve these recordings? I’ve attached screenshots of the device health and recordings. These are definitely NOT 720p as advertised. I have 102.2 Mbps download and 19.47 Mbps upload according to Rings in app link to bandwidth place. Should this be enough to provide high quality security camera recordings?I’m subscribed to the cloud service which is nice however the quality (poor to bad) and length of the videos provided (20 - 30 seconds) is just terrible... Especially since I’m paying for a service. The camera stops recording after 20 or 30 seconds no matter what’s happening in front of it. Someone can approach the door and just hang out for 20 seconds then take something without the camera recording it.Motion detection; sometimes the camera doesn’t detect anyone until they are walking away, then I may only get a 20 second clip of them being there. Shouldn’t this device keep recording until the motion stops? Someone came up to my door and rang the doorbell, however I only received a 20 second clip of the event. After the 20 seconds they could have taken anything off the porch they wanted without being recorded. The bottom line is if there is motion ongoing within range of the device it should keep recording. If Ring is limiting the length of the recordings because Ring cloud can’t support anything longer than 20 seconds which doesn’t do us any good, then unlock the capability to locally store my recordings without Ring cloud. Not just download them, but capture and store them on a NAS. UPS delivered a package to the door yesterday and it didn’t show how it got there, the box just magically appeared...With these limiting factors it hasn’t taken my kids (or the neighborhood kids) very long to figure out how to defeat this device. They can bang on the door and remove tables and chairs from the front porch without being seen by the camera because of the 20 second recoding limit. This is a FAILURE on the Ring camera.',\n",
       " \"I've had it for 6 months now, and I'm disappointed.I've adjusted the range/sensitivity multiple times, but it still has far too many false motion triggers, so you end up ignoring it. That's certainly not what you want from a product like this.It often misses recording people as they walk toward the door, but records them as they walk away. But that's not much help in identifying who they are.The recorded audio makes a whistling sort of sound. It's annoying, like fingernails on a chalkboard.I bought this doorbell camera because I have the Ring security system, which is quite good. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the doorbell camera.\",\n",
       " \"So sad this product isn't better executed or quality controlled better.  I really wanted this product to work as the features advertised would have been ideal.  Unfortunately, upon receiving I was not able to get working properly after repeated attempts.  And I am quite technical savvy having 20+ years experience in IT systems implementations and network engineering.  People come to me to troubleshoot their network issues, so this wasn't a dumb user issue.  Home network is 75/15, Netgear high speed dual band router, which I tested with speedtest to confirm.  Keep in mind you have to use the slower 2.4ghz band, so Ring does not support the more current and faster 5ghz Wifi band.  Another negative, especially if pushing video across the network.Below are a few observations:1). Amazon delivered item fast as usual2). Product is nicely packaged, and includes everything needed to install including tools and simple instructions.  Kudos to the packaging company.3). Item is a bit larger than I anticipated, but acceptable since it can be fully battery operated, which I needed.  Appearance is clean looking, color choices are nice.  It doesn't seem to be water proof since bottom center section has opening and you can see some of the electronics.  But placing at the front door under a porch could be fine unless you hose down your house or have high humidity, not sure it would hold up?4). First thing I did was charge as recommended.  Charging was very quick, so it came nearly fully charged.  It claims to last a year on a full charge and is rechargeable, which is a nice feature.4). Setup using iPhone app seemed quite simple, but following the steps did not achieve the desired outcome.  On the first attempt  I was able to setup an account just fine via the Ring app, and was able to successfully connect to the Ring and the Ring connected to my network fine, showing completed successfully, got the big green check mark.  I was excited it only took minutes and so happy to see the positive message.  However, I could not get the device to show video.  When the button was pushed, I would get notified on my iPhone 6 on iOS 9, so all looked like it was working, but upon accepting the call, I had no video, just a spinning circle until it finally gave an error of IO Error, Call Error.  I waited and tried pushing the button again, got notified on my iPhone, accepted the call, same thing, just a spinning circle, which eventually timed out with same error code.  The odd thing was the device recorded the calls and picked up sound but no video, which I could see separate events in the app under recent activity.  So, events are being recorded to the Ring cloud, but no video?  It looked like I was getting close to working properly, just needed to complete call connection and get video to work.  I tried several more times and same issue with no video.Okay, maybe just a glitch somewhere during setup, so I reset the device back to factory setting and figured I would just start over and try again.  Reinstalled the Ring app, logged in, and I removed the existing device, closed down and rebooted iPhone so everything was clean, opened Ring app to Add Device.  My online account was already setup, so logged in, started setup process where I connected to the ring network just fine but I could not get it to access my network so it failed installation.  I tried this a few times confirming my network passcode was correct, even rebooted my modem and router, and each time Ring failed to connect?  So now I've wasted way too much time with this item.  Very glitchy, unreliable setup process, and apparent poor quality or defective item or maybe an issue supporting iOS 9?  Something that should take minutes has now consumed hours.  Not happy at this point, so I decided to cut my loses, repackage the Ring and return for a refund, and move on to another solution.5) Returning to Amazon was simple, rebox, print label, attach and drop off at UPSI could try another unit, since quite a few people seem to have their Ring working, but others report similar issues and glitchy notifications, etc., which tells me there may be quality control problems.  If you get a good one, you might be fine?Great idea, I had high hopes, unfortunately for me my unit failed to install properly.  Yours might work?Good Luck!!!\",\n",
       " 'Bought this to help with solicitors and other unwelcome visitors. So far, it seems the motion sensing is completely confused. Although set only to detect to the edges of my property, the motion detection alerts for every single car that drives by, but twice this week, people have come to the door to leave packages (one was opened by an incorrect recipient and I really wanted to see which of my neighbors brought it back) and there was zero alert or video recording. How can this be considered an effective device if it tells me every car that passes, yet allows people to come to my door and leave items without triggering the motion detection? Close to worthless.UPDATE 8/29/18: I contacted Ring customer service regarding this constant issue. The hold time to speak to a representative was literally the only disappointing part of the experience. My rep easily accessed the videos that demonstrated these issues and he came up with a potential solution immediately. They sent out an angle kit which helps the camera focus more on the porch and walkway than the street and the results were excellent. While we still get ocassional notifications for cars passing, they have been greatly reduced, and the camera now detects all movement on the walkway and front porch. Last night it even caught a sneaky cat slinking past the porch. We were so pleased we went ahead and purchased a Ring wireless spotlight camera and solar panel for the back area of our home.

       " 'I absolutely love this doorbell. Our single chime we have in our home is on the main floor and we would be home and not hear the doorbell when we were in the basement or upstairs.Camera*For us it works great. The camera is good quality you can see a car driving all the way down our street and see what is going on across the street at the neighbors house. Our front door and porch is fairly wide open, after we got ours my father wanted one so I helped him install his at his house. When we turned on the video the image looked terrible, he has a long deep hall kind of a front door, so the image is all distorted by the \"light at the end of the tunnel.\" I have heard several people complain about that so think about what your front door is like before buying, or be willing to place the doorbell in a creative location.Talking through the camera*I have successfully had conversations with my front door guest with me hundreds of miles away. It is wonderful, I can clearly see who is at my door and be able to say hey im at the store I\\'ll be there in five, I think the door is unlocked go ahead and go in or whatever. It is a great feature.Recording*The recording is amazing, and it is only $30/ year for the service. I do quite a bit of transactions of craigslist where I have people come to my home, well now I have a video of them just incase they steal, harm or threaten me in anyway. It is very easy to email a video clip to a friend or the police you never know what you might need.App*The app is easy to use, but I have noticed just a few times that the app fails from time to time right when somebody rings, so I don\\'t get a notification or realize, but I have extra chimes now, which are easy to use so I still know somebody is there. The live view feature is wonderful, when your traveling you can check on the house easily. You can just check to see if you have a package or whatever, very convenient.Motion detection*We get several notifications of cars driving by because engines put off quite a bit of heat and this product isn\\'t just simple motion its a moving heat signature, very cool, but it picks up cars often. You can adjust the motion distance, but cars are so hot that 1 of 4 cars that drives by is picked up on the camera. If somebody doesn\\'t want to be filmed, they try to just knock on your front door, but surprise they are being filmed anyways, not just filmed but audio is recorded too! Same with somebody dropping off a flyer.Installation*Don\\'t be intimated by this at all! You download the app and there are several videos of step by step what exactly to do, anybody could install this, trust me, trust yourself you can do it! I was reading alot and watching all the videos when I was installing so the first time took me about 40 minutes. The second time I installed one it took me about 10 minutes.',\n",

With easy-to-use app, and the availability of having a motion detector upon it oh, this was the perfect unit.Many of the pros consist of quality of picture, the ability to intensify the sensitivity of the motion detector, the distance you can actually see in the daylight and at night time, in the easy lie manageable assembly of the products to your wall.the battery life on the device last for a while, but depending on the sensitivity that you put on the device in your settings will determine how long the battery charge stays.We would have the device on a very sensitive setting so the battery would not last as long as what we would expect. but it was simple to find out when the battery need to be charged through the app.when the battery would get down to 20 in below percent, we would bring it inside and charge it on our lightning charger. It was very easy and convenient to have the app let us know the level of the battery.It was nice that has a motion sensor on it and to be able to capture the photos of anything or anyone that passed by licking her bro. The picture quality was very good, even when he zoomed in to a far distance. We were able to see across the street, almost being able to make out license plates at over 75+ yards.I would recommend this product to anyone that either owns a home or even rents.  It's quick, easy, and is easy to take with you if you move.\",\n",
       " 'I think this is a good product. Since Amazon owns ring doorbell it very likely there will be changes especially since Amazon has come out with their own camera and cloud storage service that is really in a direct competition with the ring doorbell/camera. The Lifecycle of this product is probably just a few years. Even if the unit hold up that long it likely to be overtaken by better cloud service or newer design features. In the meanwhile, at $99 it the least expensive way I found to get in the camera/doorbell experience. Once you have it you will likely never want to give it up.  Why Amazon is selling this unit at a $ 99.00. One thing to note is be sure you activate the camera before you mount and test out your mount location. It is likely the location of your existing doorbell may not be the best location.  If you do not mind the unit sticking out some you can buy an adapter that puts about a 40% angle, however this was still not enough to make a difference in my application. I ended up moving my doorbell location to consider getting the entire area of my front entry area, (see pictures). Also, think about trees or shrubs that may move with a wind blowing as this will set off motion and you want to minimize this as much as possible.  On the battery models you don’t need to hook up to power. In my opinion that the life of this battery units will be worse if you do hook up to doorbell power. The unit does not use the power directly, just to do a trickle charge on the existing battery. Voltage and amperage is key and even being off a little will cause battery failures, if you do want to hook to power you can buy a transformer made just for rings for around $20.00. Of course, if you’re like me you down want wires to show meaning you must drill through walls etc., thus my decision to go with a battery model.No issue with motion detection or just picking up the end of the event as some have reported. I run current high-speed cable modem and router. The software is good and likely has been improved and updated over time. Motion adjustment software is better then the NEST outdoor camera system for my home.  I still have some bushes in the peripheral view of the camera that would move with the wind at times and give false motion. The software allowed me to cut this area of motion and any false alarms. The fee for cloud storage is $3 month which is lower the NEST at $5 per month on each unit.This is the only camera/doorbell that was compatible with WINK, which is the home automation hub I have standardized my home. Using this doorbell through an automation HUB opens a whole new level of function for the doorbell/camera in terms of, lights, heating, cooling, locking and programable actions that can be customized. I am also a ALEXA fan and it’s nice to be able bring up the doorbell camera on the Alexa screen.',\n",

Months of discussions with very kind people in customer service at Ring, but clear lack of solution based service. Effort doesn't make a product, and in the end, SERVICE is defined by solutions. This has been a disaster, as months in no solution, now comes the game of saying it is my carrier etc. Likely the best thing to do is buy a competing brand and see if they are all this poor, or if this is special Ring know how. What I do know is the security cams in my home were easier to set up, they too are wireless (wifi). I am far from a computer idiot, and therefore this can not be attributed to incorrect set up very easily. Admittedly the set up seemed well thought out and simple, but in the end, if a $265 smartphone video doorbell makes no sound, streams no video I fail to see how this is not just a $250 brick.\",\n",

       " 'I loved the idea, and how it worked for the first few days.  After that, and guidance from technical support that doesnt solve the issues, it is not much more than a pretty doorbell.  My issues are the following: 90% of the time I get a notification stating there is motion at my door it will not allow me to see what is going on.  After going into the app and clicking on the link for that motion detected, no video is displayed.  I have played with the sensor range and have not found a good position.  If I put it all the way out it picks up the cars on the street.  If I bring it in any less that the 30ft range, it doesnt pick motion up until someone actually rings the doorbell.  Finally when it does pick up a video it starts recording too early and ends too soon.  The UPS man will drive into my circular gravel drive and it will start recording before you can see the truck (just hear tires on gravel.)  The video stops recording before he gets out of the truck with the package.  This is extremely frustrating because part of the reason I got this was to catch my mailman on video pulling into the drive and literally throwing my packages on my porch without getting out of the truck.  Doesnt work that way if the video stops as soon as the vehicle stops moving.  Great concept, and it appears to work for many people, just not me.',\n",

I didn\\'t need it for the ringer but it\\'s also a WiFi extender so I kept it too ☺️***Update***I purchased ring cameras for my home and it seems like they are throwing off my ring bell camera, the delay in the ring camera makes this thing useless to say the least.

I just got the other two cameras installed about 3 weeks ago and thought it just picked up less street activity based on where it is located but HOW does the camera catch the delivery driver in my driveway and the ring bell does not activate as he leaves boxes on my patio????

       " 'Well my doorbell faces my garage wall so I also bought the adapter so the view would face anyone walking on my sidewalk to my front door ( garage sticks out from the rest of the house which sits back). Now I had my son in-law install it ( I myself don’t touch electric or plumbing 🤣) great video and I lowered the range so it doesn’t go off if people are walking by on the sidewalk which is on my side of the road. Now yesterday I got an ring video of 2 guys who thought they were slick not ringing the doorbell and just knocking on my storm door which I never heard but the video camera picked it up and so I told them did you see my no soliciting sign by the corner of my garage as you passed it ? And that was it and they left. The only thing is on garbage day the truck makes so much noise ( the arm grabs the city owned garbage cans and lifts it up and then bangs the can upside down and then puts it down and all that noise n vibration sets the ring video alert off but that is only once a week . I feel so much more secure and I can answer the door from my iPhone and don’t even have to go to the door if I see that this person is a stranger. Plus if I am not home and I get an alarm that someone is at my door then I can talk to them on my phone and they have no clue if I am home or not. It is great if you live alone or have young kids in the home so no one has to go to the door and see who it is. My neighbor across the street has one too. In today’s world it is a must have. Too many strangers going around and knocking on doors trying to sell you things or pretending they are and  scoping out your house and even looking in your windows if no one answers the door.  Plus you spend more money per week on groceries then the cost of The Ring so better to have peace of mind.',\n",

       " \"First, installation was a breeze, so I had high hopes.  However, it did two things wrong which were fatal flaws:  (1) It constantly alerted me to motion when no one was there, and (2) it DIDN'T tell me when someone was there, even if they rang the doorbell, which did sound in the house.First:  The motion sensor would constantly go off whenever a car drove down the street, in spite of many times adjusting the settings in the app.  I tried calling the customer service people, and while nice, couldn't get it perfect.  They recommend I purchase, for $20 a tilting device that would angle it down to avoid the false positives.  OK, I bit.  However I would get packages delivered to my door, and not only would I not get motion  notices, If I checked the log of recorded events it would not show the delivery.  The last straw was when the UPS delivered the Tilting mechanism to help this problem, (which I bought from another retailer) and rang my doorbell.  The doorbell never recorded the delivery!  I should have read the APP reviews before I bought the unit.  The app reviews are much lower than the product reviews, and since you view the info from you app, that is critical.  At least Amazon returns are easy.\",\n",
       " 'This review is half negative, half positive. Negatives first:I purchased this for my small office on Prime Day along with an Echo Show because ring supposedly \"integrates\" with Alexa. The only integration is that when your Chime or your phone alerts you that someone\\'s at the doorbell, you can ask Alexa to show the camera. Alexa doesn\\'t tell you that there\\'s movement on the camera or that someone\\'s rung the bell; it will ring/alert on your smartphone app and/or a Ring Chime if you\\'ve purchased one, but then you have to ask Alexa to show you the camera (Echo Show). If you DO ask her to bring up the camera, you still can\\'t talk to the person at the door or allow them to talk to you. I\\'m not sure I\\'ll ever use that function, but it would be nice to have. Tapping the alert on your smartphone automatically brings up the doorbell camera, including the speaker, so the Alexa integration with this product is pointless.Further, after your free trial, it only records if you purchase a plan through them. You can still view the camera live, but you can\\'t see video of anyone who rang the doorbell while you were away or didn\\'t have alerts turned on. Plans are cheap - I personally only need the basic plan, which is $3/month or $30/year, and the professional plan is only $10/month or $100/year - but comparing it with other services (such as Arlo, which I also use), it\\'s not something that\\'s usually required.For the positives:As far as the product WITHOUT Alexa, it\\'s nifty. You use your smartphone to be alerted to motion and/or when someone rings the doorbell, and there\\'s an optional \"chime\" device that\\'s required if you want it to ring elsewhere than your phone. Do not get this if you expect it to ring through Alexa. If you just need a doorbell camera that can be accessed remotely, my experience so far is that this is a pretty decent device.It can be wired into your current wired doorbell, or it can be used wirelessly. Our wiring is pretty scary, so I\\'ve had it on WiFi. I\\'ve been testing it by keeping it on and recording almost constantly since the day it arrived, and the battery is at 50%. I count that as a positive, because not only was it not fully charged when I installed it, my only comparison is a set of Arlo security cameras, which I\\'ve had to charge as often as every two days if there\\'s been high traffic. Installation was easy, but looks like it could be more difficult if you\\'re installing into brick or concrete.Overall, the statement that it \"integrates\" with Alexa is TECHNICALLY true but absolutely pointless. It works well with my iPhone 8, and I just ordered a Chime, which I\\'m excited to try out. I was extremely upset when I first figured out that it didn\\'t work the way the description and reviews seemed to indicate, but it\\'s grown on me and been very reliable so far.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ll revise or extend my review if things change.First, the packaging is exceptional.  Very nicely done.  Instructions are good.  When I installed the doorbell and two chime units, it all worked.  It took a bit of trial and error, but eventually it all worked.  I was happy.But it\\'s now having issues:1.  It\\'s hardwired.  At first, it was ringing our hallway doorbell just as billed.  But for some reason, it quit doing that.  Hallway existing doorbell has been silent for 3 days. I\\'ve tested a lot.  The hallway doorbell certainly works, I can remove the Ring and connect the two terminals underneath and the doorbell rings like it used to.  But the Ring has quit actuating the doorbell.  Yes, the diode is installed and oriented properly.  I checked the diode with my VOM, it\\'s working.  Something happened after about 2 days of installation and Ring quit ringing the hallway doorbell.2.  Motion Alerts falsing.  In fact, every motion alert (between 15 and 25 a day) are all false.  I\\'ve reduced the motion alert to 3\\', but it still falses.  I\\'ll probably turn that \"feature\" off.3.  My Ring app shows a whole slew of events, but they cannot be deleted.  In fact, they don\\'t exist \"in the cloud\" and that\\'s why they cannot be deleted in my app.  They\\'ve escalated my trouble call to the next level.  I think there may be a bug in the app that deletes the events at their cloud site, but under certain circumstances, leaves them on the app.I\\'m really anxious to having my Ring work properly and am looking on the Internet for help.  When the problems are resolved, I\\'ll update my review.',\n",
       " 'I give it 2 stars because for the money, you should be getting a lot more quality. Even though the build quality is great, the actual quality of the camera and sensors are not very impressive. The camera records in 720p and believe me its nothing compared to the quality of the pictures shown on the website or box. Sometimes, depending on the location, you may get a bright light that destroys visibility. To make this a little more understanding. If you have a porch, due to the shadow casted by the roof, you will only see a bright white light past the porch area. This sucks because you miss out on so much details. Also the sensors can be very annoying at times. They will notify you with a delay or they will trigger on by some movement or car that passes by. There is sensor adjusters but they wont make much of a difference. Also I have had some issues with the charging system when hardwired. That could also be caused by the power coming to it. Sometimes battery percentage will shift randomly. I have had the battery last longer on my battery powered than my other hardwired. Some of these cons that I have listed are not entirely bad. I could learn to deal with them but you do pay a lot of money for this product and I would expect little issues like this to not exist. The idea is amazing, and the technology required is at a minimum. I believe Ring could develop a product with all these little glitches fixed. So would I recommend? Depends, I spend roughly $700-800 on 4 Ring Video Doorbells, ring also charges $30 a year \"PER DOORBELL\" for cloud recording which only saves motions/rings. So that brings me to $820-920 for 4 Ring videos doorbells with cloud recording for 1 year. In 5 years that $30 a year per device will add up to be a large number. At 720p resolution with 40-50sec clips, roughly 5-6 recordings a day they could have made it a $30 per year bundle which I think would be fair. So at $820-920 you could go and purchase a premium 16 Camera DVR system that could be set up to do the exact thing while recording 24/7 at 2k resolution for no yearly charge and lets not forget \"16\" cameras. BUT this method does require some time to setup, so I am lazy and prefer to be done in 4 minutes and don\\'t mind the yearly cloud cost. So decide which option fits you, that is all I will recommend.Thank you!',\n",

It has remote viewing (you need it hardwired or solar powered to prevent the battery from running down).  only downsides are the recording is short & could use another 2 minutes added. Also this is hooked into your wifi, so if your wifi goes down, you have no video. Would I recommend this? Yes, since it can give you alerts on your smartphone.

Nickel and dime you for a tiny bit of storage.  Blink cameras give you FREE storage, and the camera quality is better.Edit - and even the app is annoying.  After 30 days it continues to make me dismiss the message that my trial ended.

I get notifications when vehicles drive down my street but not someone walking up my driveway, only after they've already left. I don't have stairs so that's not the issue. I even bought a wifi extender but no improvement. This doorbell doesn't even see me drive into my attached garage. After I've already pulled in & the door is going down, I get a notification. The doorbell is no more than 10 ft, if that, from my garage door. It's no more than 15 ft from my router.

       " \"We were so excited to make this purchase and awaited the delivery. It is built very well, came with everything I needed to install it. It says that in the description but I wanted to mention that in my review because it meant so much to me. As the outside of our home is masonry I did use the INCLUDED masonry drill bit. It worked great and this door bell is mounted solid as a rock on my home. I had just learned about video door bells by actually seeing a different brand. I then went to youtube to learn more about the one I saw and realized it only worked by a rechargeable lithium battery and could not install to my existing doorbell wiring. While I was on you tube I then discovered this Ring doorbell and learned about it. I then looked up reviews and read some articles about the different models available. Yes I like to do my research. For my needs....I didn't need any extra face plates, the clarity of the video described in all the reviews I read stated the difference in clarity from the 720p to the 1080p was marginal. There are a few other minor differences but for us this Ring Doorbell is awesome.  We've used it for about a week. Our daughter came to our home while I was at work. My mother in law told her I had installed this, so she thought she would check it out. I was at work and sure enough I received an alert to my cell phone. There I see my daughter and start conversing with her. I asked her how long was she at the door before she first heard me speak to her? She said about a second or two.  I was so amazed and so pleased. Some evenings I work late and my wife is home alone. Now knowing that she does not have to go to the door to answer it if she is home alone truly makes her and I feel more safe and secure. We highly recommend this product!\",\n",
       " \"I really wanted to love this. After seeing my neighbors post crystal clear videos from their Ring doorbells on the Next Door app, I thought this would be a great security tool for the house. Unfortunately, I've found it to be endlessly frustrating. The first problem I noticed is that I'm not getting anything close to 720p video. We're talking circa 1998 dial-up internet quality. I went through all of the troubleshooting of testing various distances from my wifi router, and even with the doorbell right next to it, I'm getting the same low quality. I even tried out the Chime Pro for the wifi boost and returned it when I didn't see any difference. The most troubling thing though is that the connectivity of the doorbell to the network seems incredibly finicky. There are times when everything is hunky dory, and then there are times when I can't get a live view on my phone at all. Probably related to this, motion detection notifications only seem to work part of the time. Yesterday, it picked up a garbage truck driving across the street. Today, it completely missed two different package deliveries right in front of my door.After drilling four holes into the brick of my new house to install this, I can't say I'm terribly happy with the product. I've read many complaints online that some of the firmware updates have messed up what was once a great product. Who knows? It has so much potential, but if it only works part of the time, it's kind of worthless as a security device.\",\n",
       " 'I research EVERYTHING before buying, but apparently I didn\\'t research this enough.Most of the time when I try to connect to either answer a ring or just to view, it doesn\\'t connect. \"Activating\" \"Connecting\" \"Trying to Connect\" \"Unable to connect\" So what else is new?Here are the three scenarios I have experienced:1) Sometimes it actually does connect very quickly, by accident I presume.2) Other times it takes 30-60 seconds, or longer, to connect. Anyone who has pushed the button has left by then.3) The other times it never connects and I either just have to try again (and again) or force-stop the app and try again. I really do have better things to do with my life.I called their \\'customer support\\', and I use that term loosely. All they would tell me is that it\\'s my fault... the internet, the router, the signal, the weather... whatever. The device is hardwired to my existing wiring (not running on battery) and my router is less than 15\\' away. EVERYTHING else in the house runs flawlessly on the WiFi. All except this thing.But is it working even if I can\\'t connect to it and view it, or answer the door? (Which sort of negates having it if I can\\'t connect to it when I need to.) On the occasions when the app opens, if I look at the history I can see that it has recorded events. However, it usually starts recording AFTER the person is already very close to the door. (Yes, I know how to set the zone sensitivity.) And then I can watch them walking away from the door. By the way, I don\\'t recognize most people from just their backside. And when it does record movement, it records for only 20 seconds, even if movement is still taking place. If there\\'s a slow moving person, I MAY see them come to the door, but not whatever they might have done on my porch or on my property after the first 20 seconds. Again, mostly worthless. For example, recently a delivery vehicle came to my house, and I did see that in the recording, but only AFTER they parked, not driving up. But after 20 seconds it stopped recording, so I never saw the driver get out of the vehicle, never saw him/her walk to the house, and never saw them return to the vehicle and drive away. The next recording was of another car driving by (already halfway past the house) and the delivery vehicle was no longer there. The device never saw or recorded it leavingSo, if you\\'re Ok with being unable to see or connect to the device most of the time, this is definitely the device for you. And if want to buy mine, please let me know. I have no real use for it other than to look at it and realize that I made a mistake buying it.UPDATE: If you enjoy paying for things EVERY MONTH, then this is the product for you. Without their \\'subscription plan\\' (monthly FEE) the only thing you\\'ll see if try to view the camera, is a live view (if it works at all). Who was the person that knocked or rang the bell 2 minutes ago? You\\'ll never know. You have to PAY AND PAY AND PAY to see that. I\\'m disgusted with this POS.',\n",
       " 'My original review is below. I am updating it because of a rare occurrence. The folks at Ring, after seeing my initial review, contacted me and offered up REAL customer service. A gentleman name Max made me a phone appointment and on the phone he asked permission to view the videos from my doorbell which I granted. After viewing them he told me I had a defective unit and processed a new one to be sent along with a wedge kit to help solve the motion detection issues. He also included a prepaid shipping label to send the defective unit back. I received it within a few days and switched out the doorbells. The difference was like night and day. The video quality is excellent and the wedge helped to solve some of the motion detection issues. I saw that Ring has added a settings option on the 1st generation of doorbells to limit motion detection to \"people only\" if you have the problem I was having with cars passing the house; constantly setting off the motion alert no matter how you try to adjust the settings. The wedge kit I now have installed has allowed me to avoid the constant alerts from cars without turning off the motion alerts entirely but I\\'m also hoping Ring will roll out the option of \"people only\" motion detection for the Ring Doorbell 2 which will hopefully just about perfect it. I had to decide whether to upgrade my review to 4 or 5 stars based on the still \"not perfect\" motion settings but decided to go to 5 stars based on my belief Ring will perfect it and the extraordinary efforts they made to offer up genuine customer service and fix the problem. I should also mention Max followed up with me after swapping the devices to make sure I was happy. Bottom line; my review went from \"disappointed\" to \"very pleased\".___________________________________________________________________________________________________I joined the Ring doorbell frenzy and I am disappointed in the product. The supposedly 720P video is very poor and fuzzy on my hd cell phone screen and 4K desktop monitor despite the very strong wifi signal and close proximity to the router. Secondly, the motion detector settings are very inaccurate. Despite setting the range to be nowhere near the street which is about 50 feet from my front door, the motion detector still alerts sometimes by a passing vehicle. The only good purpose it does serve is to alert me someone is ringing the doorbell if I am not home. Because the video quality is poor I do not bother subscribing to the cloud service. What good are saved videos that you can\\'t see well? Perhaps the newer 1080P Ring doorbell is better. There are some 4K video doorbells coming out but I\\'m sure they will be expensive. I\\'ll wait a few years until the price comes down and then replace this unit with a 4K model.',\n",
       " 'Where do I start, I both this device as a gift for my mother. My sister in law installed it per the included instruction connected to a 16V power source.. The companion app notifies you of doorbell button press and detects motions even rang the analog bell on the wall but the live video feed never worked. I did not get a chance to look into it until 2 months later. The device is getting optimal connection to the router (RSSI – 33). I opened a support ticket with help@ring.com, here what I have done so far based on my conversation with support.1. Removed the device from the app and reinstalled it ( did this 4 times already)2. Moved the router approx. 2 feet from the device3. Disconnected from the home router and connected the doorbell to my phone hotspot4. Shared the device with ring support so they can look at the device activities, etc…. (they showed no activity on their end although the app is getting notification 20+ times a day)5. Did a factory reset on the device then reinstalled the deviceNow, support is telling me that I have to open multiple ports on the router. If the router is the issue, step#3 above should have resolved the issue.For a device that supposed to be simple and easy to install (It says so right on the box), this install is turning into a second job for me. One week of back and forth communication is too much time invested in a video doorbell.I asked support to send a replacement device. Sometimes you just have to admit that the device is defective out of the box. (it happens all the time- hence the warranty)  Ring support is still insisting that the problem is somewhere else and not the device. The email exchange continues……I’m looking at Nest as a replacement. I don’t trust that Ring support will resolve the issue.I will update this review If support is able to help resolve the issue.',\n",
       " \"I like this product, but it is constantly going off with false alarms.  Yesterday was a windy day and it was going off from the tree branches swinging in the rain.  Some times it signals after the person at the door has already turned their back, i.e. newspaper carrier.  I had to call Ring support, and I will say that they were very helpful.  I have another question for them that I haven't called about yet, but I expect the same great service.  Once I hopefully can get the quirks worked out, I hope I will be very satisfied.\",\n",
       " 'The Ring Doorbell will let you see who’s at your door, even when you’re not at home. It works with your WiFi and smart phone to give you wireless video and two way communication with someone at your door. To successfully install and use a Ring Doorbell, you will need an Internet connected WiFi router, and a smartphone or similar portable IOS or Android device. Additionally you can connect a Ring Doorbell to your existing household doorbell wiring to both power the unit and activate your doorbell chimes.The Ring Doorbell PackagingThe packaging was easy to open and all the parts were nicely tucked in their own compartments within a plastic tray inside the box. The packaging also had a clever flap on the outside that covered small windows that show potential buyers what is inside the box without forcing them to open it first. It seems like this flap is held closed by a light magnetic closure hidden within the paper of the packaging. The only thing that isn’t revealed without opening the box is the Ring Doorbell itself. The package contains the Ring doorbell, a short micro USB charging cable, a wall mount plate, a small screw driver, a drill bit, a small bubble level, some wall anchors and screws, a diode (for use with non-mechanical door chimes), and a small installation and setup guide. Depending on your mounting preference, you may need to provide your own drill, and I also found a small pair of needle nose pliers to be handy.Physically Installing the Ring DoorbellThe physical install is pretty straightforward. Attach the Ring mounting plate to the wall, snap the Ring doorbell into place and secure with the two special screws already inserted into the bottom of the Ring doorbell. If you want to connect to your existing doorbell wiring, you’ll need to remove the existing doorbell button and attach the wires from that to the Ring mounting plate. If you don’t have a mechanical chime, you might also need to use the included diode when attaching the wires. One alternative to avoid drilling holes in an exterior wall would be to use industrial strength double sided tape, or some other strong adhesive. You just need to be certain the mounting plate is securely attached to the wall so it doesn’t risk damaging the Ring doorbell if it comes unstuck.Smart Phone AppThe product install documentation will direct you to install the Ring app first. There are apps available for both iPhone and Android. There are a few simple steps to set up the Ring doorbell, though I ran into two roadblocks with my installation. First, my Ring doorbell was shipped to me with the battery completely drained. It was necessary for me to charge it for about 20 minutes to get enough power to start the setup process. Second, I kept running into a problem near the end of the App setup process. It would stall as the Ring Doorbell was connecting to my WiFi and I’d be presented with a screen with four choices asking me what the Ring Doorbell was doing. Three choices for the Ring Doorbell LEDs flashing in one of three specific patterns, or “nothing”. In each case, I’d see the LEDs generate the pattern indicating they were connecting to my WiFi, then…nothing. Pressing the “nothing” selection in the Ring app just kept brining me back to the start of the WiFi connection process. This happened four or five times, and just as I was dialing the Ring support phone number, the process completed and the Ring app proceeded to the “setup complete” screen.I couldn’t find the recently added feature that lets Ring Doorbell owners start a “live view” of the video feed from the doorbell. Ring’s help documentation clearly states where this should be available in the app, but I didn’t see it. It was necessary for me to contact Ring support and have them enable the feature for me to see it. I don’t know if this is normal, or perhaps related to going from battery operated mode to being wired to the house doorbell circuit, but I never found any documentation to indicate I’d need support help to enable the “live view” mode.Once the Ring doorbell setup is complete, using the app is simple. Depending on your settings, the app will alert you when anyone pushes the doorbell button, or motion is detected, or both. It’s up to you if you want to answer or not; the Ring service will record video in either case. Interestingly, the service will also record any interaction you have with the visitor at your door. This way you can review exactly what you may have said to that pushy sales person. The app also shows you battery status, lists recent activity, lets you set up your motion detection settings, etc. You’ll also need the app to invite/manage others in your household to use the Ring doorbell service.Web User InterfaceIn addition to the smart device apps, there is a web interface. The web interface offers users similar features as the app with a few small differences. Live View doesn’t seem to be available via the web interface. There are similar filters for different types of events. These include when the doorbell button is pushed and answered, button is pushed and unanswered, motion is detected or events that have been tagged as a favorite. When there aren’t any recorded videos, the interface for the filters goes grey to indicate there is nothing to filter, and unfortunately there is no mouse over description available to indicate what each filter does. Users can select events to delete with check boxes or use a “select all” link at the top of the events list. Unfortunately the “select all” feature is global, even while a filter is active. I accidentally deleted all my videos when I thought I was selecting all the filtered items using the select all and trash buttons. There’s no way to recover videos from the trash, so once a video is deleted, it’s gone for good. The web interface, like the phone app, allows you to download and share videos as well. There are share links for Facebook, Twitter, email, the Ring Media Team or Community Support. You can also generate a “public link” (URL) to let others view your Ring videos directly on the Ring service. Anyone you share the link with will be able to view that specific video.Overall ImpressionsI’ve used the Ring doorbell for a couple of weeks at this point, and over all I really like it. It’s not perfect, but based on the relatively low cost to get a video doorbell, it’s pretty good. It isn’t so far away from my WiFi router that I’ve noticed any problems with video issues or other failures.You can generally forget catching most delivery people. While that’s great in marketing materials, and might be possible sometimes, it isn’t really possible under normal conditions. By the time you receive notification that there’s been movement, or perhaps a delivery person pushed the doorbell button, most of them are already halfway back to their vehicle. At least you can see that something was delivered and have evidence if it was mishandled.I’ve noticed that at some times of the day the doorbell doesn’t do a good job of catching motion at my front door. Based on what I know about how the Ring motion sensor works, I assume this has something to do with the relationship between body temperature and ambient temperature. In any case, it probably captures 90% of all the motion right at my door and it has always alerted promptly when someone pressed the doorbell button. I have yet to experience it generating any false alerts.For the most part, I’m very impressed with how easy everything was to setup and use. Other than the minor problems I had with WiFi setup, it was easy to install. I was impressed by the feeling of a quality device I got when I opened the Ring package and started going through the parts. Providing most of the necessary tools is also a big plus in my book.I’ve mentioned a couple of minor issues, but they can probably be fixed by updates from the Ring development team. I do wish there were some scheduling features to let me define how the Ring doorbell functions at different times of the day, or when I’m away vs at home. Again, those are things that can be added later. I’d happily recommend the Ring doorbell to my friends or anyone looking for a way to see who’s knocking without leaving the comfort of your couch',\n",
       " \"Installed the ring and it mostly works fine; we are challenged to get the field of motion down to a level that satisfactorily minimizes the motion sensor notifications from light breezes outside.  We have really shrunk it down yet still find an annoying frequency of notifications.  Also, the app seems to load very slowly -- when I get a notification on my phone and click to view the activity, there may be 15+ seconds of lag time before the app opens.  By that time with a live view, I could miss a person altogether.  I have noticed on at least one occasion that the notification came an hour+ after the activity at the door.Last, I found that Eufy makes a similar unit that is less expensive and does not require purchasing a subscription to save activity to the cloud.  Wish I'd bought that one.\",\n",
       " 'Not worth the money. One minute delay to come on. I have 100mbps speed so I have plenty of internet. The delay allows someone to come all the way to the door and inside before it notifies me. It \"rings\" after the person has walked away. It is directly wired to the house so its not a battery thing. The settings are wide open , it should be \"ringing\" all the time, not just when someone has already been at my door for 2 minutes.Provides a false sense of security. The recordings only show who has been there it does not provide a real time service. The delay is scary. My son managed to come to the door, open with his key and get to my bedroom all before the thing ever went off. It is set to the most sensitive setting and should be going off a lot. Cars driving by, dogs walking by etc. It does not. The thing it seems to pick up it the garbage truck which is where this thing is going once I buy the new camera system for 288. A waste of 100 bucks. Its a toy.',\n",
       " 'The Ring is not ready for production and should have never been sold to the public.I think the biggest issue is because it doesn’t record 24/7. Instead it only records when it detects motion.  Add that to the fact that it has no onboard storage - so it has to store everything online.Too bad it sucks at detecting motion. It only detects after someone is walking away from my door.  Basically, I have hundreds of videos of cars driving by and the back of the mailman as he’s walking back to his mail truck.I haven’t seen a single face yet. People come up to my door, leave a package, and then take a picture of it on my stoop - and then walk away. The only thing recorded is the back of the delivery guy as he walks away from my door.PLUS. It’s grainy as hell. Video quality is not like the ads. It garbage.  Pixels on top of pixels.and like others have said - their support is no help. They all say the same thing: “it’s my network”.But, no, it’s not. I have an amazing network. I’ve done multiple speed tests and it’s blazing fast. But - Because they suggested it - I bought a WiFi extender next out it next to the Ring. That didn’t change a thing.  Still garbage.And - now - on top of all of this: after one year it’s WiFi stopped working.No matter what I do, I can’t get it to connect to any network. Not just mine, I’ve tried multiple networks and it just won’t connect.So, now I have a camera that starts recording way too late, only records the back of people as they leave my doorway, has crappy pixelated quality video, that has no functions at all now because it won’t connect to the network.I have other cameras in my house - I spent no more than $40 for any of them - and they always work - record all day long - and have HD quality.  Why are we buying the Ring?????I hate that I spent so much money on this and now I have to go buy one that works. I think I’m going to go buy the google nest camera. I hear that one works great.',\n",
       " 'I disliked that it was always kind of slow, and flakey about notifications. Support is friendly, I guess, so that’s a plus.Avoid, try another brand. It is useful to have, but doesn’t function well, other than to show you the idea is useful if it was only competently implemented. Try any other similar product.Died after 2 / 3 years,  never damaged and the only interaction it had was fingers pushing the button, so.. not sure why that would ever break. Hard wired too, so not a battery issue.',\n",
       " \"Installation is straightforward and easy. App for iOS is well made. Sensor image  contrast is lacking and the bitrate of the awful 720 makes it feel like I’m watching a video recorded on a 2008 flip phone. The zone detection settings are basic )seemingly hard for the doorbell to screw up but it still fails pretty bad. Objects such as cars outside of the user set zone still register as movement while pedestrian movement within the user set zone isn’t registered immediately, if at all. Anecdotally I had a package delivery occur where the driver stops the truck in the field of view, walks 40 feet to my porch, rings door bell, sets package down and goes back to truck. The doorbell didn’t register movement. It only started recording after he pressed the button and walked away.If you’re considering this as a “kill two birds with one stone” setup for “I want a doorbell that watches for shady stuff going on in my yard and driveway” you’ll be let down. Just buy an actually security camera for that. This will likely miss that dude that smashed your car window and took your laptop because it didn’t happen within 6 feet of the doorbell.The day after I wrote the original review, I had a package theft that the doorbell missed most of the action. Observe in the video as the camera is sensitive enough to trigger an alert for a passing car in the street. Watch the timestamp change to the very next consecutive motion event. Observe as the camera only starts recording as the thief closes the car door and drives off. I'm tempted to knock the rating down, but I'll leave it 3 stars for now to not appear dramatic. But this could change again.Later edit. Yeah, this is lucky to get even two stars. Two stars go to the software dev team for the app. The hardware is garbage and shouldn’t be on the market in 2019. I bought a Ring Pro and all I can say is wow. Save yourself the trouble and get that.\",\n",
       " \"Pros:  Complete and thorough installation instructions and all tools needed to install it (except a drill motor).  Solid and well engineered.  Battery operated for non-wired installations and if your doorbell is wired, it keeps the battery charged.Cons:  I can not get the motion detection to work without the doorbell being pushed and even then all I see is the persons back as they are walking away.  iOS and Windows 10 App's are slow to respond.  Very poor (720p) video and no video on demand.  Relatively expensive.Followup:  I now place this item into the category of total JUNK!  Live view does not work nor does motion sensor.  A total waste of money in my opinion.9/24/16:  And NO longer works at all.  What JUNK!!!!!\",\n",
       " \"I've played with the settings for about a year now, and there are still times where we'll get motion notices on our Ring apps, only to see absolutely nothing going on outside.  The app is a little slow to open, but overall it and the Doorbell do what they says they will.I also ran into an issue this past winter where it ran out of power and I never got a notification about it.  Ring never did have a great answer for why that was.  We got this one as a Black Friday discount; I'd say definitely shop around and see what else is also out there before deciding on Ring.  I don't think you'll go wrong with Ring, but I wonder if other competitors have better products.UPDATE 11/06/2019:  A Ring representative reached out to me after my initial review and helped troubleshoot the issue.  He was kind enough to send out a set of the angled wedges on the hypothesis that the direct angle facing the street was resulting in 'false alarms'.The Ring-brand wedges were kind of tough to work with; I broke the heads off of three of the screws trying to install a couple of them, resulting in only being able to get one fully installed.  This was with my drill-driver at low torque; I can appreciate the slimness of the screws so that you're not drilling huge holes in things, but they're really not made for strength.In getting everything set-up, I noticed again that my Ring had low battery, and again I wasn't alerted via the app or email about this, as I've got enabled in the settings.  This is particularly frustrating, as the unit's supposed to last on the order of months without needing charging, but without manually checking every so often I don't feel like I'll get a reliable notice that it's time to charge it up.However, all of that aside, it does appear that we're getting less false alarms with the wedge installed.  It's not a huge angle, either, but apparently just enough that we're not getting notices that someone's at our front door when it's just a car driving by.  We're about 15-20 feet from the road, with a single step in front of our small porch, and I've got the settings in the app as restrictive as I can make them.Also, installing the Rapid Ring app has helped with receiving notices.  It's a lot faster to alert me than the full-sized app (which I've also still got installed for full functionality); it brings up the Live View a little slower than I'd expect, I'm using a OnePlus 3, which isn't the newest phone on the block but shouldn't lag terribly.  If I needed to talk to someone on the other end of the doorbell, tho, it'd only take a few seconds to bring that up so it's not the world's biggest issue.Overall, I'm adding a star to my review because of Ring's customer service and the improved situation described above.  It's not perfect, but certainly better than it was.\",\n",
       " 'Don’t buy this product. I have had it almost 1 year and 3 months. That’s it before it died. Will not charge, will not turn on. I was on vacation when this happened so  I had no way of knowing till I got back that it wasn’t a dead battery, but a dead product.For the 1 year and 3 months I did have it, it was an okay product. Just okay. If the sun hits it a certain way it will not pick up anyone at your door. I had to buy a Wi-Fi booster for the 12 feet it was away from my Wi-Fi router and it’s still had major lag, would not always capture sound or only capture sound and no video. Often, by the time the camera turned on, the person at my door was already walking away.When I got home vacation I tried charging it. 15 hours the first day, 8 hours the next. The front light would never turn on. I tried restarting it from the orange button and nothing. The first night I tried contacting ring support from the chat feature, 19 min wait and 8 minutes into waiting, the chat just dropped me. This happened twice. The second night I finally chat with and agent and literally it went like this: “trie holding the orange button for 30 seconds”. I did and nothing happened. Agent says the device in probably no longer working and since the warranty in out (by less than 3 months) I will just have to buy a new one. I ask if the company has any offers (since most companies will at least give you a discount when a device dies so soon after the warranty) and the agent is like “no” when I ask to cancel my account I left waiting for over 5 minutes. No answer, no response not even an “agent is typing” message. I spend the next 15 minutes trying to figure out where in my app and account I can cancel. I could not for the life of me figure out how. I even went to the help section. I finally give up and call the 800 number. This agent doesn’t even ask why I am canceling.Honestly for the cost of the doorbell and the booster this is NOT worth your money. Find another video doorbell. When it worked it was okay at best. But for it to die for no reason And for the company to be so “oh well” about it after spending so much money I do not recommend the Ring doorbell.',\n",

That seems like a long stretch. I’ve had to charge it 4 times already in less than 5 months. Sadly, the battery life is the least of it’s problems. When I try to watch live view I always get the “activating device” loading screen and eventually error connecting to Ring doorbell. I have to deal with all these false motions all day and the very rare time I actually hear something and need to check I can’t connect. The video also doesn’t start recording until whoever was on the porch is walking away or it doesn’t record long enough so video cuts off before the person leaves. What good is a video doorbell that doesn’t record people causing the motion, and that won’t connect. At this point, the Ring doorbell is causing me more grief than anything. There’s nothing about it that would make me want to recommend it to anybody. None of it’s beneficial features work properly. Having a Ring doorbell ring is as good as having absolutely nothing',\n",
       " 'Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video DoorbellI\\'ve had my Ring for almost 2 weeks now and it works GREAT!Problems I had on start up:1. My iPhone was not set up right. I had to turn on Microphone and Camera in the Ring App after downloading and activating it.2. A week WiFi signal at the Ring Doorbell location was detected by using the Speed test at bandwidthplace.com (recommended by Ring Support). I ran the test next to the modem then at the Ring Doorbell location. It was at or above 2.0 download at the modem and below 1.0 Mbps at the Ring Doorbell. Ring Support recommends at LEAST above 1.0 at the Ring DB.3. The low WiFi signal prevented the video from appearing on the iPhone every time: The modem is in a metal \"Communication\" cabinet in the laundry room. I did a temporary fix by taking the metal door off the Comm Cabinet. I\\'ve ordered a WiFi extender for a permanent fix. Ring support suggested one of these:a. TP Link - TL-WA850RE WiFi Range Extenderb. Netgear - EX2700 WiFi Range Extenderc. If the extender doesn\\'t work then I\\'ll relocate the Modem.4. My wired doorbell button is in a wall perpendicular to the front door. I temporarily placed the Ring DB there and pressed the Button. The video generated showed my profile and did not get a full on face shot. So, I relocated it to the Door Frame just above the door knob facing down the driveway. Now the video records a full face shot of the \"guest\".5. Like Munchiniwa observed on April 17, 2015, it appears that motion detect is a bit delayed and you do get the back of someone who does not hang around.a. With that said a Termite inspection guy set off the motion detector and I answered it while several miles away from the house. I engaged him for his business and told him I was indisposed and to come another time after his office called to set up a time. He thought I was home during the entire conversation. The video is a Hoot!! Here\\'s a link to watch it: https://ring.com/share/34365502. REMEMBER I was several miles away from the house when I was talking to the guy. How cool is that!6. Also Munchiniwas noted he could not access his videos on a computer. That is correct for live feeds and interaction with a \"Guest\" at the door. However, you can log in at Ring.com and select \"Activity\" to view and download any video taken by the Ring DB. You can also email the video via an email icon in the Ring.com site under \"Activity\".I\\'ve shared my experience with a few friends and they have committed to purchasing a Ring Video Doorbell.I hope this helped with your understanding of the Ring DB and gave you some better insight on it.Thanks for taking the time to read this [...]',\n",

I saw on the news where the Amazon cloud was down the day I had tried to reach them so tried again.  This time I connected with Ring very easily,  After almost two hours my problem was partially resolved.  Had to bump me up but the new guy was able to tweak my router and get the connection to my phone.  Only problem now is it won\\'t notify me when the doorbell is rung.  We set up my tablet and laptop too and although they all get the picture none get the sound, yet, when the technician added his phone as an additional user his phone would ring when I rang the Ring doorbell.  I tried it using my wifi and using the tower.  So now I have a camera.  If I\\'m home and in the house, I hear the house doorbell since I am hardwired.  If away from home - just luck if I see the call on my phone when it happens otherwise, nice camera.  Ring\\'s customer service was awesome.  Spent almost three hours with me trying to resolve this issue.  Unfortunately it\\'s not totally resolved.  Great when it works.Update:  I\\'ve had the Ring over six months.  Worked great at first but I was never able to get a live feed.  Then it started to ring when no one at door.  Sometimes when someone is at door I would get a black screen.  Finally it quit ringing when someone was at door.  Now it will not connect at all.  Basically it is worthless.  Tried to call customer service.  First they answered but no one picked up when call was transferred.  Now I get a message that there was a \"application error\".  Finding the customer service number was a chore to begin with.  Something fishy going on.NOTE: THIS IS WHEN BOUGHT MY FIRST SAMSUNG GALAXY J4.  NOW THINK IT JUST DOESNT WORK WITH THAT MODEL PHONE.It deliver as promised.  My entry way is obstructed so I don\\'t get a picture until the doorbell is rung.  Usually the delivery person has walked away before it starts filmimg.  However that\\'s my problem and not Rings fault.  Otherwise, I\\'m very pleased with the device.',\n",
       " 'Update:  After having great customer support the first time we had an issue, we had another issue.  The Ring.com response was \"get a wifi extender\".  Given (a) it had worked fine in the same spot for 8 months, and (b) we already had one, it was a bad response from Ring.Perhaps their success has gone to their heads, but very disappointed in their response recently and do not recommend ring.Initial review:All in all, I am happy with the Ring doorbell.  It doesn\\'t look bad, was pretty easy to install and is pretty functional.  Hopefully software upgrades can fix some of the cons.  The biggest con was that both the speaker and microphone stopped working after about 6 months.  However, Ring sent a replacement quickly and it is working again.All in all it works well and is functional.  When you need technical support it seems good, the person I spoke with was knowledgable, friendly, and was a native English speaker.Pros:1. Pretty easy to install the hardware.2. Easy to install the software and connect to your wifi network.Cons:1. In my install it was a bit difficult to get the bell to snap into the mounting bracket.  I had to push it somewhat hard, but it did go in.2. The biggest con is that you can\\'t store the video locally and have to pay an annual fee to do so.3. It would be nice if it did about 3-5 seconds of video prior to the motion detection starting.  This would be probably only possible on the hard wired version, but if it could keep a few seconds worth of pre-trigger frames buffered, it would be most useful so that you\\'d see the person coming into the frame.',\n",
       " \"Ok I installed my Ring Doorbell 5 days ago. I am not completely satisfied with it so far. I am having intermittent problems with the Motion Sensor. Sometimes it picks out a person delivering a package and sometimes it doesn't. Yesterday we had UPS,Amazon Delivery and the Postman. My Ring Doorbell only picked up the Postman making a delivery. None of the delivery people rung the doorbell so the motion Sensor so far is not dependable. I called Ring Customer Service today and was on the phone with them for quite awhile. She said my Wifi is reading a -69 on my Ring Doorbell and it has been as high as -75. She said a good reading would be -50. I told her that we are not having any problems with any of our other devices including streaming on our Firestick. I don't question our Cisco WIfi. Furthermore the Wifi is no more then 25 ft away from the Ring Doorbell. She wanted me to call my Internet Service Provider to ask them if they can set up 4 ports to match my Ring Doorbell. I told her that I own my own Motorola Modem and Cisco Wifi Router. Infinity (Comcast) says they can't go into my Router being I own my own equipment. Right now I am waiting on Ring Customer Service to get back to me.  We have a friend who lives in another state who is having the same problem where their Ring Doorbell is not showing on video all deliveries to her home. I am guessing I am not the only one with this problem. Hopefully Ring can get this problem straightened out. What good is having this Ring Doorbell if you can't depend on it to work every time I have to ask? ADD ON: Its been about a month now and I have had nothing but problems with this unit. I even purchased a more expensive top of the line Wi-Fi Router from Amazon to replace the one I had. It brought the RSSI reading down to -54 from what I had previously. Didn't really make much of a difference at all. 90% or more of video's that are recording are of Cars and Trucks setting this Ring Doorbell off  and I have tweaked the sensors down to their lowest setting. Makes no difference better then 30' away it still sets off this Ring door bell. My wife or daughter leave in the morning. Sometimes the delay is so great I barely see them walking out the door. Now the sound is even sounding choppy. I don't know what more to do. Customer service has been back and forth by email. Seems like the person emailing me works during the middle of the night possibly. The last 2 messages I sent in the last week have not been answered now today I see I am now 2 days past the deadline to send this item back to Amazon if I cared to. Bad enough I had to open the area up where our original hard wired door bell was mounted and use a Oscillating Multi-Tool with cutting blade to cut a molding around our door assembly that contains the center door with 2 sidelights in order to fit the Ring Door bell. It is going to look terrible if I was to go back to a standard doorbell again. Not a happy camper at all. I should of did more research on this item. What they show in the advertisements on TV doesn't come close to how this unit really operates. I wouldn't recommend this Ring Doorbell to anyone.\",\n",
       " 'I ordered this Ring Video Doorbell two months ago. It arrives in stylish packaging (typical by today\\'s standards, thanks Apple). The instructions are very easy to follow and they supply a multi-function tool to attach the doorbell to your exterior. It works fairly well, however mine is a bit of a lemon that still has not been resolved by Ring. I attached my doorbell hardwired, meaning I attached the preexisting wires to my new doorbell. All functioned well for a couple days and then I noticed that the button on the doorbell was no longer illuminated. I called support to find out why, and the customer service rep either didn\\'t know how the doorbell functioned or just couldn\\'t explain it well, but stated that my button would not be lit. Even though I stated that I had hardwired my doorbell. I asked why would they design a doorbell that doesn\\'t light up? It was a confusing back and forth. Note:  If you hardwire the doorbell, the button stays lit. If you only use the built-in battery the button does not illuminate to save charge and you have to recharge the battery manually. Hardwiring will trickle charge your battery since the electricity is low voltage. If you hardwire and the button is not lit, there is a problem because the hardwire is not charging the battery.  I called back the next day, speaking to a different associate and they realized that there was a problem because my doorbell was hardwired and NOT lit. So they updated the firmware. It worked. The button lit up and my app said \"power source: Hardwired.\" A couple days later NO LIGHT and my app said \"power source: Battery.\" The unit had, for some reason switched to battery source only.  Four associates later, it still is not working. One associate sent me a new backplate thinking that would solve the problem. It worked for about 5 days. Another associate suggested that I attach my doorbell to a piece of wood to act as a flat surface since my doorbell is mounted on (flat) concrete block. I did as instructed and cut a plate from exterior grade 3/4\" thick FLAT board, mounted it to the concrete block feeding the wires through a cutout and attached the doorbell to that. Had to call again to have them help with resetting the doorbell to recognize the hardwire. That lasted 24 hours and then the doorbell went back to battery as it\\'s sole power source. I called again and now they are sending another part to mount the doorbell to. They think that the front part of the unit is not flat against the back plate. If so, it is because this unit is faulty, not fault in my mounting. This has been a so frustrating. Although the customer service reps are very nice. They are, in the end not very helpful. They each send a followup email stating that if I need assistance again,  email them. However it has always turned out that the doorbell stops working properly on their days off, so I call again to speak with someone else.  I work in the construction industry and some electricians I was recently working with said they had also had problems with RING and they recommend NEST doorbell by Google.',\n",
       " \"I was very hopeful and it seemed like a good idea, but this doorbell (Gen 1)  just has not performed from the day it was installed. I have the Ring hardwired and connected to a brand new interior doorbell that was installed at the same time by an electrician. Unless you press the Ring button firmly the light will spin but the contact does not engage the interior doorbell. My available wireless is also at the low end of the bandwidth for the Ring so by the time my phone or tablet alerts me it can be more than a minute. In many situations it is the motion sensor that is activated and alerts me. This doorbell including motion detection is so slow that I seldom know that a package has been delivered until the couriers or USPS are in their vehicles and driving down the road. Many a day I have found a package has been delivered but the delivery person has been crouched as they place the package and then if they are moving fast even the motion detection may not be activated as they leave and I get no record of the delivery (I use I a wide band of coverage and high sensitivity). The only person who gets regularly captured on the Ring is me as I enter and leave the door, so I know the motion detector does work. Delivery people are moving fast and they seem to be able to evade the motion detector which gives me little hope that a thief would also be recorded. I have had this Ring jam up about every 6 months, particularly when there is an update. This is a real pain as you have to unscrew it from the wall to reset it and if you are on vacation the Ring becomes useless. I have contacted customer service multiple times they tell me that I have to upgrade my internet DSL service or router, move the Ring closer to the access point or buy the newer Ring. Upgrading the DSL will double my monthly internet access so I opted to add an internet access point extender to the front porch (did not help), upgraded my router (helped a bit) and added a second access point (helped a bit more). Rather than spend a couple of hundred dollars to upgrade the Ring, I spent $25 on a Wyze security camera from Amazon. What a difference. Every time someone gets near the front door I get a quick motion notification that someone is at the door. Now I get all sorts of notifications of someone or an animal (usually deer) near the front and this motion is often not reflected by the Ring. The Wyze does not charge a monthly fee to access the recordings and they have software that allows more control that what is on the Ring including live view. The community security reports on Ring are also useless as I live on an Island and the zone of coverage excludes part of the island but includes part of the mainland which has the majority of the criminal activity. I've been gone for 3 weeks and it is clear to me in running the Ring in parallel with the Wyze camera, that the Ring is just not a good security device in my situation. While I was gone, my Wyze camera repeatedly recorded up to 5 times a night that the Ring light was coming on erratically but the Ring was not recording anything - the Wyze camera was clearly much more sensitive at recording any motion. I am going to drop my Ring subscription and rely on the Wyze camera for security recordings. The fees I was formerly paying to Ring will be used to buy additional Wyze cameras. I would not recommend that anyone buy a Ring doorbell unless they are already paying for very fast internet service, and even then, an inexpensive camera like the Wyze may be a better option to monitor your front and other doors.\",\n",
       " \"When it works, it's great. Most times it doesn't. It's sketchy. I have the fastest internet my ISP offers and my house,  shop and property are populated with WiFi range extender pods. My modem is about 12 feet from this doorbell. With time, here's what I get:-Someone rings the doorbell it frequently either takes a minute or more to connect if it connects at all.  Sometimes it connects right away.There is always a delay between a target being in range of the motion detector and it alerting. One day I watched the UPS guy drop a package right in front of my door, walk back to his truck and drive off before it ever sounded. Twice it failed to alert at all when shady people came up on my porch at 3 AM and 2:30 AM. I was fortunately awake both times and chased them off. Real comforting for an old guy who lives alone!-The range adjustment is about useless. It either gets too much -when it works- or it gets nothing.-Recently it has started showing a 'weak WiFi' signal message but my WiFi coverage extends far past where the door bell is.As I said, this keeps getting worse over time. I bought it at the end of December 2018 so it isn't that old.But, I will say the camera's image is outstanding! Far better than anything my other security cameras show.I was hoping this would be better than it is because I wanted to replace my security system with Ring products when my contract expires. Now I'm not so sure that's the way to go.\",\n",
       " 'Update Dec. 12, 2018:  Received the replacement today.  Installed it quickly and easily.  The motion and doorbell feed worked fine.  However, the live feed did not work at all.  AGAIN!  I followed all of the troubleshooting tips in the app:  wifi speed check (MUCH greater than the 1 MBPS required up and down) and checked the signal strength of the router to the doorbell (RSSI-47, which according to them is \"greater than most\").  Still, did not work.  So...I called Ring.  Again.  I was told to take the doorbell over next to the router (because all doorbells are directly next to the routers they connect to) and check it.  It magically worked, but only within a few feet of the router; outside of around 5 feet it wouldn\\'t perform the live feed function.  My doorbell when installed is less than 15 feet from the router, with one wall in between; I can literally stand at the door and see my router with no issue.  Not to mention, I have other security cameras using this same router mounted over 50 feet away that work flawlessly with no extenders anywhere.  The Ring \"customer care\" guy (I use that term loosely also, they really don\\'t care about the customer) told me I needed to buy their wifi extender...for the 15 foot distance between the router and doorbell.  Needless to say, I\\'ve had enough of Ring already.  I\\'m returning the replacement they sent to me back to Ring, and returning the original back to Amazon.  I highly recommend going with something else unless you want to constantly deal with problems and poor customer care.  Read more of the reviews here and do a basic internet search and you\\'ll see a lot of the same; I wish I had done more homework myself and avoided the trouble.  My other cameras are Blink and work great, with no cloud cost requirement!  I\\'ve dropped by rating from 2-stars to 1-star and will never bother with Ring again!Dec. 11, 2018:  Had it in service for less than two weeks before the screen went black, live view quit working, and overall it quit working as it should.  Did some research and this is quite a common problem with these things.  Contacted Ring for support, they’re sending a new one in 5-7 business days; I got this one in two days from Amazon.  Not impressed-thought this would last longer than this and they would have a very well known issue resolved by now.  Concept is good and video was good when it did work.  Not sure it’s worth $100 then $3 per month for the cloud storage.  Will update when the new one gets here and it has been in service for enough time to tell if anything changes.',\n",
       " \"We installed our Ring a couple of weeks ago and are pleased so far.  We are still tinkering with the motion settings but install, configuration and performance have lived up to expectations.  The package came with all the tools we needed to install it.  I was on break at work when Ring alerted me about motion at the front door.  Wife was letting our dog out and when they came back up on the porch, I started talking to them... Dog was puzzling at the Ring, trying to figure out where I was.  I also noticed that the Amazon driver takes a photo of stuff he delivers, once he sets it on our porch.  I'm sure we'll see other interesting things on our Ring videos, hopefully all good.I wired the Ring to our conventional doorbell circuit and the battery has maintained a 100% charge, even with frequent use of the live view feature.  Other reviews have mentioned the surprising coverage area of the lens.  As can be seen in the photos, Ring captures our entire porch, most of the front yard and the three houses across the street, day and night.My only concern was how to mount it beside the door, as the wood trim wasn't flat and not quite wide enough.  I mounted the base on the wood trim, extending onto the vinyl siding. Then I carefully filled the gaps behind the base with a bead of adhesive caulk to make for a more solid, attractive installation, (pictured).  If you do that, just be careful not to slop any caulk over the edge of the base and onto the front surface where it mates with the Ring housing and electric contacts have to be made.  We’re happy with the functionality of our Ring, so plan on paying the $30 yearly subscription to save and store the videos.Ring provides quite a bit of security at a reasonable price and was dirt simple to install and set up.\",\n",
       " 'This unit is very sensitive to movement at the door, all the way to the street.  There is no hiding from the view all across the front of the house.  When someone rings the doorbell, you simply use your phone to open the speaker so you can talk to them before you open the door {or chose to stay anonymous until they go away}.  It\\'s great to have options.It also records movements that you don\\'t have a desire to follow up on, incase you need the information. Your smart phone is key.  Simple \"hook it up\" and wifi will keep you up to date on activity.I know when deliveries are made and where the packages are placed.  I know who is coming to visit.  I know who to ignore and I know when the neighbor drives away (very sensitive but not obnoxious}.',\n",
       " \"The Ring doorbell does come with everything you'll need for installation. However, the drill bit included did not cut it for my brick wall.  I had to purchase another brick drill bit, which helped. I couldn't figure out how to keep the tip from slipping on the brick though (call the professionals lol).  I had to charge it for five hours before installing it. There is a significant delay in recording , and sometimes it doesn't sense motion at all. I mostly get motion leaving, not coming. Also, I'm not a fan of the fish eye lens view from the camera. Although its showing 100% wifi connectivity, the video quality is not that great (day or night). Overall, I would purchase it again because I do like the two way speaker. I'd rather see a little something, than a lot of nothing ~\",\n",
       " 'Pro: It\\'s a wireless doorbell, powered by a rechargeable battery. If you need that, it is effective. (If your doorbell wiring is connected, you can hook it into that, and not have to charge it, but if your doorbell wiring is connected... why are you buying a doorbell?)Pro: I got the Venetian bronze one, and it looks pretty slick.Pro: It was easy to install (every tool is included, except that you use your own drill).Con: The app (without which it is useless) apparently tries to make customers scared enough of their neighborhood to spend more money on security products. I expected that, because it\\'s 2019, and \"distort reality to make sales\" is just how apps work now, but this was really on another level. There\\'s no verification of people\\'s reports of crimes, so there ends up being a notification on my phone every time a racist sees a black person, a teenager feels like a prank, etc. I turned this off.Con: The function where the unit detects motion offers extremely coarse-grained control with a bizarre user interface, and I was unable to find any settings where it was useful. Not only do I get notifications for passing cars even after adjusting it to prevent this, but motion wakes it up so slowly that many times I seem to be getting notifications for nothing at all. There is no way to store video clips from detected motion except their $3/mo cloud service, so in addition to all that, I\\'m paying for the privilege of having my comings and goings at my own house documented on someone else\\'s computer. I turned this off, too.(Special note in case any Ring developers read this review: just show me a picture taken by the device, and have me paint a mask on it to separate the porch/not-porch parts.)Con: The claimed battery life is VERY optimistic.Possible con: You pretty much have to get a Chime to go with it... If I have my phone with me, my guests can already call me to get my attention. I anticipated this and also bought a Chime, and so for me personally it\\'s fine, but it\\'s something to bear in mind.',\n",
       " 'It has a great look, the installation was super easy and it pretty much does everything I could ask for. I do not have it hard wired in so I have to charge it about once a week. It’s not a huge deal but if you can get it wired in....I’d say it’s worth it. My house has never had a door bell so I may need to consider getting someone to wire it up in the future. Another critique on having to charge it is just needing to be aware of approximately when it should be charged again and check it.....I wish it would send a push notification when it was getting low. My only other complaint is the sensitivity is hard to manage.....i’ve Just succumbed to allowing it to record as much as it can and dealing with it. Now I say that but ironically I’ve also found that at times there must be a delay. I’ve had the recorder trigger and record when I know people have flagged it but I never caught video of the people themselves. All in all I’d say it’s worth it. Perhaps newer generations of this device will solve some of these issues.',\n",
       " \"I got this during a 35% off Black Friday sale, I probably wouldn't have bought it at $200. After all its a doorbell with camera. It is very well constructed and is a quality product.It comes with all fitting materials.This has been a very useful household edition, in particular before Christmas with frequent package deliveries. It has prevented us from getting any deliveries stolen from outside our front door. Many of the package delivery companies push the door bell as a matter of course now so you always know when something arrives. I'm sure the bad guys are aware of ring.com doorbells, and they would act as a deterrent too.The motion sensors are a bit flaky at times, falsing quite a bit, and I have played with the sensitivity settings quite a bit to reduce this, and  still sense people arriving at the front door.Quite amusingly, my wife emailed me and told me there was a package outside the front door that I hadn't noticed because I'd left my phone at home. She was in the UK at the time, and I live in the United States!! I use it in wireless mode (internal battery), the ring designers should really relocate the USB charging port to the bottom of the device, so that it could be recharged quickly using a portable USB battery pack, this would remove the need to take the doorbell off during recharge periods.Also, I wish that Ring.com would create and equivalent product that would piggy back onto the doorbell that could be used as a mailbox alarm as well with a different tone, so you know when your mail has arrived too. I hope their product designers are reading reviews, there is a second level market just waiting to be had!All in all an ingenious product!\",\n",
       " \"So far I'm pretty dissapointed in my new Ring.  The live feed option just shows a blank screen for starters and takes forever to load.  The support forums basically chalk that up to being poor wifi signal but all my tests from next to the device show in excess of 50mbs download and 20+ up with very low latency.  I'll move my wifi router closer to it when I get around to it to see if that improves the performance but I doubt it given current tests.  Something wifi can't be blamed on is the lag or latency in start up.  My Ring is in an apartment building and is pointing all the way down a long hallway.  I have the sensitivity set to maximum distance for motion detection but it still takes so long for the camera to start up that I can easily walk down the hallway at a normal rate of speed, unlock my door and enter my apartment without the camera picking me up and by the time it is recording I get 20 seconds of empty video.  So far the only thing it's really useful for is the doorbell feature but I already had a doobell so yeah.  This morning I crossed the hall to feed my neighbors cat while she's on vacation and the ring didn't pick and of that up and only caught my backside, after feeding the cat going back into my own residence.\",\n",

       " \"I actually started out with the Ring home alarm system first and then got the Ring device after the fact. It works great. Maybe too great. I live off a main street and even at the lowest sensitivity, I would still pick up passing cars all the time. It got bad enough to the point that I had to turn motion of all together! Fortunately, the customer support at Ring sent me a free wedge, which basically angles the device down some so that it picks up less traffic. Now only the people are captured, which I'm fine with. I turn off notifications still but I can go back if necessary to see something.I have my device hard wired, but I will day that I don't think I would have purchased it to run on battery. This model doesn't have a removable battery and the battery runs down pretty quick. This means you will have to dismount and charge the device every time, which kind of defeats the purpose of having distant security. I had to remove one star for this obvious limitation. Please noe that even with it hard wired, it is still better powered. The doorbell power line merely trickle charges the device, so it is very possible to run down the battery even while having it hard wired, so just beware of that it you intend to purchase this model. The Ring 2 has a removable doorbell.Also, the device is almost useless without Ring protect. You cannot record any video without the cloud subscription. I think this is kind of lame on Ring's part, but fortunately, it's not expensive and provides an extended warranty for you devices and has an unlimited amount of devices for only $100 a year or $10 per month. If you only want one device, it's $30 per device, per year. That's the worst deal in my opinion.Overall, great product, not perfect, but great and I'm happy with it.\",\n",
       " \"I set mine up on battery power, with Ring and Motion alerts enabled.  I've gone through two devices in less than five months.  It's always something with this thing.The first doorbell always showed 100 percent battery right up until the battery died.  And, it just died.  No soft shutdown where it saved settings before turning off.  Just died.  After charging, I had to set it up all over again.  Just about the time I had realized how long the battery lasts, after using it for three months, it lost all audio functions.I finally got the replacement about a week later.  Unlike like the first one, the ring button didn't work right from the start.  At least the button on the first one lasted about a week.  It occasionally rings, but usually not.  Fortunately, when somebody walks up to the door, the motion detection picks them up at the sidewalk, then, when I finally get an alert twenty or thirty seconds later, they're standing at the door, after having already pushed the button that does nothing, so I can just start talking.That's IF I actually get a video feed with the option to answer the call.  That video feed with the option to answer the call quit happening this week.  All I can do is watch the recorded cloud video after it finally finishes saving to the cloud four or five minutes later.  After five complaints to support in four days about this, Ring finally admitted it was an issue on their end and that they have no idea when it'll be fixed.  So, if you buy a Ring doorbell right now, you won't be able to use it to answer your door.  Hint:  Don't buy one.I could even work around this issue if they would actually implement Live View like they've been promising.  But, they won't.  So, there's still no video on demand either.  Just like my old crazy aunt that used to deny your desert if you wore plaid on Tuesdays, Ring won't implement Live View for battery powered devices just cuz.In five months, I've replaced the device once, gone without audio for a week, and gone without being able to answer calls for at least a week. So, for two hundred bucks, you get a doorbell that only rings for about a week.  Two way audio that you can't use, and the ability to watch cloud videos that were recorded after the fact, in forty one second intervals.  Good luck with that.Since Ring claims Live View does work with hard wired devices, I have to go buy a doorbell transfer and some wire and hard wire the stupid thing in order to get a feature they claim to have, but won't give me, to work around another feature that they claim they have, but doesn't work.  I'm pretty sure once it's hard wired, it'll still be crap, so I'll update my review once I've done that.\",\n",

I called AT&T and they came out, checked everything on their end, we both tried to connect Ring and this time Ring would come up but would not connect. I gave up after about 4 hours of doing the same thing over and over again. I'm going with Arlo Pro, they cost twice as much which sucks but i have no alternative.

       " \"Yo know, I do love this doorbell. I mean, it does everything they say it will do---the only funky thing is---they say all you need is at least 1 Mbps of Wifi to get this thing to work. Well, I have 10 Mbps at my door where the doorbell is---and it MOSTLY works---but there are times when it does not kick in. So, I had to buy the chime/Wifi Extender. Well, that really did do the trick. Which is fine. But, WHY is the DOORBELL is COOL looking...yet the chime-wifiExtender looks like a very bad baby monitor from the 1990s?  I mean, COME ON, DESIGN TEAM!  The other thing is...I have someone else sharing the notifications on his phone. His simply does not work as well as mine. I have a feeling that the main person who sets this all up (in my case--me) ends up with better reliability than the secondary person on their phone.  Lastly---the whole thing seems to take too long to reset. I feel like if there is motion or a doorbell ring---and then 30 seconds later, there is a fresh one...then there should be a reaction. But it seems like the doorbell needs a long time to reset.  Overall, though, I LOVE that if the doorbell rings and I see the person at the door trying to sell me something, I don't have to answer!  And, I love being able to talk to whoever is at the door without having to come to the door. I love seeing my packages delivered. I love seeing the live feed.

After two customer service reps, an hour of my time and absolute buffoonery on the telephone, I hung up. I called it quits ! The device did not work, the app is a nightmare and the techs literally are guessing at what is next. At one point I asked the rep if she was asking a question or telling me what to do.

       " \"I read a lot of good things about the Ring doorbell prior to purchasing and I was super excited to give it a try. This was my first video doorbell so I decided to go with an earlier generation cheaper option to start with.The install for the doorbell was super straight forward and easy to hook up using my original doorbell wiring. I did have to charge the doorbell initially after opening before I could start using it.The app is nice and is a really good UI but I really wish there was more customization to the motion detection. I could not find a good spot for detecting motion, it was either too little or too much.  The video quality I knew wasn't going to be amazing but it really ended up being not as good as I would have expected. There was always a loud noise that I could never get rid of, it constantly sounded like there was wind blowing on the mic, even on a quiet day.I loved the fact that I could use this with my existing doorbell because I have a tube mechanical bell. Unfortunately two different devices I received malfunctioned to where it would constantly ring my doorbell for no reason. This was sporadic and at time would be repetitive. I worked with support until I received a replacement and it ended up happening with that one as well.I'm sure that the newer devices have improved greatly but I had a lot of issues with this specific model. I ended up going with a different brand, mostly because I do not want to be stuck paying a subscription to store my videos.\",\n",

       " 'Let me first say that my house is over 110 years old and didn\\'t come prewired with a doorbell - nor - a peephole.  I guess the families that lived there before me decided they didn\\'t need one or weren\\'t really worried about who they were opening the door for.  It has drove me absolutely bat-sh*t insane since every time someone would knock on the door, if I wasn\\'t expecting them, it was like opening the door blind.  I\\'m a single woman and live alone in Baltimore and even though I trust my neighbors, I\\'ve never been comfortable opening the door \"blind\".  Hardwiring a doorbell and drilling a hole through my door (or special ordering a door with a peephole) all of that seemed like too much work and too much money for very little pay back.  Since I live in the city, I\\'ve also toyed with the idea with getting a security camera.Through my research I came across Ring.  Via the Cyber Monday week deals I got the Ring security system for my house (because I want to drop ADT - I just don\\'t feel like I get that much payoff for the price) and I decided to enhance it with the Doorbell.  Not the 2, not the Pro, not any other higher level Rings.  Just the Doorbell.I am loving it so far.  It seriously took me 30 minutes to install.  The longest part was charging the doorbell for use and figuring out where best to mount it for maximum exposure to my front door.  The kit comes complete with CONCRETE screws and wall mounts and CONCRETE drill bit.  Having the kit come with a concrete drill bit was the biggest surprise for me because those are not exactly the cheapest drill bits and even though I already have a set of concrete drill bits it was nice not having to look for it in my toolkit (plus I know that not everyone probably has concrete drill bits in their arsenal).  It was also nice that they have the forethought to provide concrete screws instead of throwing in some random cheap screws.  It also comes with a small screwdriver with a two end bit (phillips and starbit) It came with everything needed to mount the doorbell.It was easy to download and register with the app and it was easy to associate it with Alexa for use with my Echo Spot.  If you turn on the \"live view\" feature of the Doorbell, you can use the ring app and Alexa to \"drop in\" on your front door live.  (You can also use the website to view your front door, however you are not able to drop in live via the website).  The Ring app is a beautiful app.  I have the \"live view\" feature turned on right now but since that means the camera is \"always on\" I\\'m not sure if I will keep it on as it\\'s supposed to drain the battery faster (I\\'m conducting an experiment on how fast it actually zaps the battery juice - I\\'ll keep you posted).The camera is pretty sensitive.  I did have the motion detector alerts turned on but I live in the city and every time someone walked by it would alert me on the app and via Alexa and that got annoying real quick, so I turned that off.  Haha. However, even though I have the alerts turned off, it still records the 20s or so of the motion that it detected and it\\'s extremely easy to view *all of them* via the app or website.  It\\'s also nice because via the Live View feature you can actually two-way talk to people, and I can\\'t wait to use that on the people who sit on my steps (\"get off my lawn, whippersnappers!\" :-)  actually, I can\\'t wait to freak them the eff out, I think it\\'s going to be hilarious!)If you have a smart home device (Echo or Google Home) then you don\\'t really need to hardwire the Doorbell into your old doorbell wires as your smart home device will ring when someone hits the bell.  However, it does come with the wire needed to install it to your old doorbell wires.Even though it is fish-eyed, the picture is very clear and also has night vision.The coolest part is asking Alexa, \"Alexa, show me the door\" and I get to see who\\'s at the door via my Spot!Overall, the Ring Doorbell was a total win for me and I couldn\\'t be happier.',\n",

Ring likes to say that they provide you with everything you need but that’s not true. You’ll need to order a wedge kit to change the  mounting angle (which nobody tells you about.) The bad news is that you can’t order it here on Amazon or pick it up in retailers. You need to order it from Ring. What’s particularly frustrating is that wedge kits are shipped with other models. So be forewarned that you’ll need to spend another $20 for the plastic wedge set or macgyver it like I did with wooden shingles.',\n",

After a year and a half, I can highly recommend the Ring Video Doorbell as well as the Ring Service.  It is well worth the piece of mind it brings to me and my family.Installation of the doorbell was straightforward and everything worked as advertised.  After about a year into ownership, the device forgot how to be a doorbell, though.  I spent a couple of minutes on the phone with Ring Technical support to find out that an update pushed to the doorbell caused it to forget it was a doorbell.  It was corrected in a couple of days and everything works as advertised.  Ring video service is good as well.  Inexpensive and the videos are helpful.  Some of the videos we see are downright hilarious.The video doorbell is excellent quality and has stood up to the elements it is exposed to and continues to work.  It is more expensive than some of the other products on the market, but I have zero regrets purchasing this product.  It has worked well and customer support is outstanding.Highly recommended if you are in the market for a video doorbell.',\n",

That I could live with because it would refocus when someone got close to the camera and it would work properly for about a minute. Then the notifications stopped coming. I checked my phone notifications to make sure it didn\\'t somehow get turned off there, that wasn\\'t the problem. I checked the app itself to make sure that the notification alerts were still turned on there, they were. I went so far as to uninstalled and re-installed the app to see if there was some kind of glitch, still not working! Now, when someone rings the doorbell I have to manually open the app, wait for it to load, click \"live view\" THEN I can see who is at the door, but the sound quality now sucks and is choppy and distorted. >:(I am a stay at home mom and my husband bought the Ring doorbell camera in order for me to feel safe at home alone all day with our kids. Now, by the time I get in to the app to, again, manually check to see who rang the doorbell, my kids are already at the front door lifting up the blinds and looking out the window to see who it is.',\n",
       " 'This product works, but not as advertised. Getting right to the point that make this nearly worthless. Product claims that the battery is good for 6 months to a year. Probably true if it is never used. I found it would not last more than 3 to 4 days before needing to be dismantled and recharged. I called the chat line and was told that the motion detection had been activated too much... 200 times in 10 days. Or 20 times per day. To extend the battery life to last 3 to 6 months (not 6 to 12 months), it should not be used (motion detection) more than 2 or 3 times a day! We are a family of 7 including 3 school age children and others with jobs. Are we supposed to sneak out the back in order to preserve the doorbell battery! Even tried to schedule turning off motion detection during times when we knew we would be leaving and returning. Still no joy. So it seems to me that if I shut off all the functionality I thought I was paying for I will be left with... A doorbell... The same thing I started with $100 ago. And if you think you can recharge the power by tapping your existing doorbell think again. Do your homework. Only a few will actual work with the Ring.Revising to 4 stars because of the extremely good customer service that was determined to fix my concerns. What was really required was an upgrade to the Ring 2. Larger battery last longer and can be recharged without dismantling the unit. Working now as I had intended.',\n",
       " 'When I first saw the commercial about Ring, I knew I had to try it and with Amazon Prime, I had nothing to lose, since I could always return it if I wasn’t satisfied.  It arrived several days later and I rushed to install it.  The packaging itself is something to behold.  Think iPhone packaging. I knew if the same amount of engineering went into the product as went into the box then I surely had a winner. Amazing. It’s worth buying the product just to see the box.  Included are all the mounting tools you would ever hope to need.  A clear plastic area over the Ring is labeled “Try me,” and of course I did and my excitement grew.  Mounting the Ring was easy.  What took the longest was making sure the Ring had a good charge.  Had our existing doorbell been wired instead of wireless, I would just have had to attach the wires to the Ring.  I did have one problem when setting up the App on my phone.  I entered the incorrect wireless password.  I ended up having to call support.  Their hours on my package said they are open 9-5 PST but they are really open 7-7.  No complaints there.  The tech support person I spoke with was terrific. It was a simple matter for them to have me reset the Ring and everything connected.  Once done I had to test it and it really worked.  Last weekend we were travelling and the Ring alerted me that we had a visitor.  It was our Postal delivery woman.  By the time I answered the alert, she was getting back in her car.  “Hey Billy, thanks for the delivery.” She responded, “Are you inside?”  “No, we’re in Charleston.”  She looked a bit confused, got really close to the Ring and asked if I wanted her to sign for a package.  I don’t think she ever realized we were 300 miles away and we could have been anywhere.  The Ring is truly amazing.  Video saved to the cloud if you want.  Two way voice communication.  A motion detector that uses a heat signature.  Are you kidding me?  It is a great product and I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " 'Update Aug 21, 2019.  The motion detector works when it wants and difficult to set in my application .  So basically I have a glorified doorbell since i turned the notifications off due to battery drain on my phone.  If only I had not paid the one year service in advance.  Look for something else if you can that has a better sensor /motion like the blink cameras. Five stars because rapid ring (new app) actually corrected all the delay issues with viewing people while they are actually at your door.I hardwired this item and it works great for live view. The app leave a little to be desired, but installation is simple straightforward and so is the actual setup to you home wifi. Note-the battery needs to be somewhat charged for you to complete wifi setup. No where in the instructions is that mentioned until you try multiple times and eventually the app will tell you to wait until the battery is fully charged.  So plug it in for at least 15 minutes and then try to setup. At least that was my experience. Overall, for the price, its a great way to watch the front door and answer it. Like everyone mentions, there is a delay, but when you are bouncing off servers and cell signals, you have to be reasonable in your expectations. Ring Neighbors (inside the app) is cool but you also see all the crazy things that go on in your neighborhood.',\n",
       " 'I received the doorbell today and after charging it. I setup the device through its phone app. I installed it outside and the doorbell feature works perfect. The motion sensor would not activate unless I was moving inches from the device. After speaking to tech support and having them tinker with it remotely it was decided that the doorbell arrived with a bad motion sensor. Now they have to process (takes 2-4 days) the request for a new one and another 3-4 days to ship and arrive to me. So in about a week I\\'ll try setting it up again and then also drop off the defective unit with the return packaging at the post office.UPDATE: I received a new unit and the motion sensor is better but not much better. Motion is needed within 5ft even after setting the default to 30ft detection and highest sensitive setting. It will still \"see\" cars on the road but not people. Also, I noticed after pushing the button the delay is long enough where most people will not stay long enough for you to respond back and the video shows the person walking away and not their face. I am disappointed and will try another brand. I would not recommend this device for purchase.',\n",
       " 'Was excited to get this out of the box and set it up but after three failed attempts with the app on three different devices I\\'m packing it up and sending it back. The setup is controlled by a \"wizard\" and even though I can connect all my devices to the doorbell via wifi, there is no way to manually configure the wifi settings on the device if the wizard fails and times out.  I tried to use an Samsung 8+, iphone 6, and a ipad  - each time the app loads and connects to the device fine but then it can\\'t finish the configuration. Tried calling their tech support but the only they said was send it back.Just to level set - my home has smart wifi enabled lights, thermostats, garage doors as well as multiple Amazon Echo and Google Home devices. We are gadget crazy. I completely understand the steps involved in connecting a wifi device via a smartphone app and my wifi and router are more than strong enough.  I\\'ve never seen a smart home device like this that wouldn\\' allow you to just connect via wifi to the app and manually type in your router credentials if it couldn\\'t transfer them itself. It\\'s crazy they have no plan B if their setup wizard fails other than to send the device back.  Their \"wizard\" is the only way to do it according to the tech support line.',\n",
       " \"I recently purchased this item hoping that it was a fix for all of our front door security needs.  The reality is that it works quite well as a doorbell but the motion sensor and battery life leave much to be desired.  This thing is a snap to install.  I had it up and running inside of 10 minutes and that includes drilling the masonry for the mount.  My wireless router is about 10 ft away from the doorbell and we seem to get enough bandwidth for a very clear picture day or night.  When someone rings the doorbell the wide angle lens gives us an excellent view and the voice communication works quite well.  The app is easy to use (except for motion detection protocols) and I have now answered my door from out of state (very cool).The downside of this device is the motion sensor and how frequently false alarms are logged.  Even if I toggle off motion detection alerts all together the device still senses the motion and records it to the cloud.  I live 40 ft from a busy city street and even when set to the lowest detection threshold the device still logs between 10 and 20 false detections per day.  I normally wouldn't mind but I am using the rechargeable battery to power the Ring and these alerts are taking battery life from 10 months (as stated by the manufacturer) to 1.5  months (estimated since I haven't completed the cycle).  I have had this device hooked up for 2 weeks and the battery is down to 55%.You would figure that with all of the false alerts that the motion detector would trigger rather easily when an actual person approaches your door, but this is not the case.  My largest issue is the delay between someone coming to your door and the Ring triggering the alert to your phone and recording the incident to the cloud.  When there is actually a person i.e. the mailman I get video of his keister as they are leaving the premises.  This makes this device completely unusable as a security device (unless the police have posterior recognition software).That said I really like the concept and their customer service is fantastic.  Although they couldn't solve the delays now they are working diligently to improve the software and make a better device.  The staff was prompt in returning all correspondence and courteous while working with me to solve these issues.  They even offered to cover return shipping should I wish to return the device.  I decided to keep it so I will update this review as the software is updated and see if the device survives a Colorado winter.\",\n",

       " 'I was fairly satisfied with my purchase of this product until I found out one thing that I missed during my shopping; To record videos, you have to subscribe to a cloud service that with the minimum plan you can only record from one device. The minimum plan will cost you $3 per month or $30 per year. There are more expensive plans and another surprise is that if you expect to get your device to be replaced if stolen, you have to subscribe to the $100 per year plan.Well to me, these revelations are unacceptable. Ring should allow you to at least record to your phone as an option or at minimum, allow for up to three free recordings per 30 days, etc.If you do not want to pay a subscription, I recommend looking at other devices or security cameras that allow recording to you phone or the devices own storage.As far as the quality of the doorbell and ease of installation; it is top notch in that aspect.Another disappointment of the device is the app you use to access your Ring device – it is a little confusing to use.One more disappointment is the quality of the video - Even with 720 HD, the image is not as good as the samples given by the manufacturer. If your doorbell is under a covered porch, you will not see well beyond 6 feet or so because it has to adjust to the lighting of the shade at your door. This means that you will not be able to see what is happening at your curb or beyond your porch because the light will be too bright to ID anything; even in \"Live View\".',\n",
       " \"I purchased this on black Friday for $99. I always wanted a video doorbell but hesitated at the regular price of $180. The installation was super easy and quick. I just removed my old doorbell, moved the wires to the new Ring one, and secured the ring to the door frame where the old bell was. The only tool I used not included in with the bell was a screwdriver and portable drill (as a power screwdriver). It all took about 5 minutes.After I download the program to my Galaxy was easy and after opening an account with Ring everything worked as advertised.With the assistance of IFTTT and my SmartThings hub, I've created a rule that says between sunset and sunrise, turn on the front light when motion is detected. So now I have a motion detected from light. It works every time.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, it motion activates (too often, since I live in a suburb across from an active intersection), it catches activity (some of it, read below), it has \"night vision,\" and it makes the house look like a modern \"smart\" home. However the free recording of the activations is only good for a month. After that you have to subscribe to a monthly (paid) service to get any real use out of it. My wife researched and purchased, I just install and review. You pay for security in a package, they just hide the fact you must keep paying for it.I hardwired it to the doorbell easily enough, but the security screws were not in the package, meaning that anyone could come up and take the hardware with no trouble. I called Ring and they sent me the missing parts, but come on, simple QC should ensure vital parts aren\\'t missing from the package.When the motion activation kicks on, it takes a couple seconds to record/ Example: UPS drops a package, we see the delivery guy\\'s foot turning the corner after he dropped the package and as he is leaving. No good if it were someone running up and taking said package. Even a higher sensitivity setting doesn\\'t solve this, it just activates the camera more often due to traffic, not faster. Ring really needs to work on the speed at which it begins a recording session.Night vision isn\\'t really the term for what it has. If you leave a porch light on, then, ok. We have streetlight across the street and it illuminates the area well enough for us, but I took the bell to the back and it was useless. Even a neighbor\\'s (bright) back door light didn\\'t give enough light to see anything. I was thinking about getting more cameras to link, but they would be a wasted purchase if they use the same tech as the bell (not to mention not actually recording anything after a month).',\n",

The biggest issue was that it was previously owned and we paid for a new one . It was dinged and had white scuff marks all over it, on top of not being wrapped in any way AND missing pieces (user guide and screwdriver). We still knew how to use it and had the tools needed to hook it up just to try it out and see if this is what we wanted to stick with. The quality was worse than our Doorbell 2 also.Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy and we ordered the Rinf doorbell 2.

When it arrived, the bottom of the unit that holds the two set screws to lock it in place was all scratched up and the screw head slots were so stripped up that I haven\\'t yet been able to get one of them out. I did manage to get the other one to screw out, and was able to force the unit onto the bracket without breaking off any of the plastic tabs, but now I only have one screw to lock it down.Even so, it works well, and I\\'ve been able to \"answer the doorbell\" from work and other places, and to see when packages arrive. I turned a salesman away when my wife and I received a doorbell notice while having dinner at a local restaurant. I told him that we had just sat down to dinner and that this wasn\\'t a good time for us. I wasn\\'t lying, as we had literally just sat down for dinner. What I didn\\'t tell him was that we were 15 miles from home at the time.We have only had a couple of false alarms early in the mornings when birds have flown too close to the unit and when our yardman passed too close when mowing the lawn. Other than that, it has worked flawlessly. I have taken the unit off once to charge the battery and link it to our new Wi-Fi router. I had no issues taking it off or snapping it back into place. It has already been worth the price (and most of the frustration). I recommend the unit, but would highly recommend paying the extra and getting a new unit rather than a used one.',\n",
       " 'I just can\\'t say enough about RING!!! I have 4 floodlight camera\\'s, 3 video doorbells, 1 Stick-up Cam and they all perform flawlessly!!!!  I\\'m even surprised they can pick up our wifi consider where a couple of them are (across a 3,500 sq. ft. home, through walls, garage and to the sides of the house) but there hasn\\'t been ONE glitch!  After using these cameras, I purchase the video doorbells......same stellar review.  Just now I put up a \"Stick-up Cam\" outside my Pops front porch (he\\'s 94) so I can see him coming and going from his studio on the opposite side of the house.  PERFECT. I can check in on him coming and going from his walks and even watch him watering his plants.  Additionally I have RING products up at our cabin which is 300 miles away and I can check out what\\'s going on up there as well.  I\\'m SOLD.  We have a fancy, security/camera system at our home.  It takes up a ton of room in my office with all the monitor/HD receiver, etc. but those hardwired cameras are not near as good as RING! Then you have to scroll through the recording to find an incident which is time consuming and a pain in the butt!  I\\'ve decided we\\'re ditching the \"security system\" and switching to just RING!  Right now I can monitor the entire exterior of my home, no matter where I am, hit an alarm if I need to and even \"make a comment\" if need be. Next I\\'ll be purchasing a few \"Stick-up Cams\" for the inside of the house for added security and to watch the dog of course! I can store videos and monitor security on ALL devices for a year at $100.00.  Well worth the money.  ALL my RING products are very well made, excellent camera/pic quality, video playback is great, monitoring via the app is spot on and so easy.  Actually, the entire setup for all RING products is so, so easy!!!  Stop searching and join the RING family. You won\\'t be disappointed!!!!',\n",
       " \"While rebuilding a home I just purchased in Detroit, my main concern was securing the home while it is getting worked on. I saw the Ring commercials in the past & remembered them when it came time to get things in order. I purchased it from Micro Center in Madison Heights, Mi & the reps there provided even more insight into it.The installation was simple enough. Charge it fully, sync it to your WiFi, download the app to your phone and/or computer, then screw it into the door frame or position of your choice. 4 screws into the frame, 2 screws to tighten the device to the lock frame. No wires & no mess. Took literally about 5-10 min for install from sync to hookup. I am usually skeptical about things proclaiming that installs are very easy but this one really was. Gets a + in my book.Camera is extremely clear, day or night, sun, rain or snow. You can adjust the range of the motion sensor from 30 feet out to any range within and adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor. You can also add on an in house door chime if you do not have an existing door bell (like me) that syncs with the ring so again, no wires OR multiple ring devices for multiple locations and/or homes. It also works very well with my recently installed Xfinity home security. I now have no blind spot.Best part is that the Ring device allows me to see who's coming to my house when I'm not there. It can make people think you are there in the home when you aren't which is another +.  I just had an issue with our local water department claiming a technician had come out to turn on the service in which the tech stated that he knocked on the door but no one was home and that he waited 10 minutes before he left. The ring doorbell clearly showed however that he in fact just walked up to the door, did not knock (when the motion sensor is set off, it records the audio as well as the video), just hung up the 'sorry we missed you' door hanger and then immediately left. They were trying to charge me a 40.00 missed appointment fee for that but instead, thanks to the Ring recording, I just simply walked into an office and showed the video. Needless to say that the charges were reversed. I have also caught a Comcast tech pulling up in front of the home, sitting there for 5 minutes and then pulling off, something else I was able to prove as well. This device is well worth the money invested and I have told/shown my friends. 2 of them have just bought it within the last few days and I am going back on Friday to purchase another for a different house. These devices aloows you to do the impossible - be in 2 or more places at one time! Hope my review helps!\",\n",
       " \"I bought this on prime day. Looks pretty good, the oiled bronze matches my door hardware. Easy installation, the package contains everything you need and directions are clear. I had a hickup in getting the motion sensor to work, but finally got it to work after resetting the interior button. What i dont like is the motion sensor video delay. Its great at getting the back of someones head, or a car driving away, but never captures the motion of the person as the door is approached, which is kind of the whole point. It captures if the person stands thete long enough. Also, when someone rings the bell and the app is accessed to see who it is, it takes a while for the image to load. By this time the person is ringing again, knocking, or walking away. My internet is pretty fast, so im not sure why it takes so long to load. All in all I wont return it (mostly due to the screw holes i now have in my door)but if i had it to do over again, i'd pass on this one. Maybe the newer version works better.\",\n",
       " \"Here's what's good:1) It's super easy to install and setup.  I installed it directly to my existing doorbell wires, so that the regular bell rings when someone pushes the button.2) It's great to see who is at the front door.  I was away, and the bug guy came by and I was able to talk to him through the doorbell, and I didn't tell him I was away.3) If you live in Arizona, and have a process server arrive at your house to serve you for the speeding camera from *%&$^%# Paradise Valley, you can watch the action without answering your door.What isn't so good:1) You can't adjust the lighting on the camera on your phone.  Maybe there is a setting, but I couldn't find it.  My door is in an area that is covered, but the street is very bright, and I can't adjust the camera to see the street when it is bright outside.2) If you get a notification that there is activity at the door, and if the app isn't running, it takes forever to start up the app to see what is going on, and in some cases the activity has ceased.  Maybe they can work on app start up times to be faster.Overall I like it, but just a couple of quirky things that are annoying.\",\n",
       " \"I liked the product but would not always capture all of the movement but only a few seconds of it. A few times it went off without movement. Also, after the 3 months of free service it cost $3 a month for service. It's been hard to sign up for it. Decent night vision. It does give me a sense of safety.\",\n",
       " \"It is so frustrating to find a good camera at a reasonable price. This is my third brand camera I have tried. Not happy with any. Looks like I need to pony up the money for either a Nest or Arlo camera. Guess you truly get what you pay for. Unlike the Blink XT 2 camera, the Ring connects to the Wi-Fi quite fine.My biggest complaint is that it only senses motion half of the time.  I've attached pictures. As you can see where the camera is placed is about 5 to 7 ft from where I park in the driveway. Most of the times the ring lets me know that there is motion by my front door after I've already been in the house for 3 or 4 minutes. Sometimes it doesn't notify me at all. Just yesterday I was on my second trip of taking groceries out of the van when the ring notified me. Guess it's a good thing I was not a burglar!Another complaint is that a few times I tried to check my live view and just got a black/blank screen. I've attached those pictures as well.So in conclusion, it is better to have than nothing at all - seeing that you get notifications once in awhile. However, the point of having a camera is to have reliable and for the most part accurate information on what's happening around my home.\",\n",
       " 'PROS: works perfectly out of the box and easy to install.  We paid for the one year plan, and glad we did.  We have a few neighbors with this, and we enjoy pranking on each other with handwritten messages flashed in front of the camera as we ring the bell.  Totally fun, and how we invite each other over.. ... who needs text?  Daughter was also told to find a new place to say goodbye to boyfriend... motion sensor comes on when they go out side and say \"bye\".  gross (says the mom)CONS: Motion sensor is overly sensitive and very annoying.  We have tried several settings and finally gave in on ignoring the motion detection.  No good way through the app for alternative notifications... signed up for free with IFTT and it works.',\n",
       " '1. The doorbell doesn\\'t seat tight in the wall plate, so if you want the doorbell to ring the indoor wired door chime you pretty much have to duck tape them together.2. Once duck taped together it makes it even more difficult to recharge the battery.  You basically need to take the doorbell off the wall plate and plug it into a USB overnight to recharge.  At least the charge holds for a fairly long time.3. Probable the most important thing hear is that you must purchase a cloud based ring protect plan to use.  This is a subscription starting at $30 per year/$3 a month.  If you don\\'t pay this then the doorbell is simple that.. A Door bell. you cant access or see any videos.  Very disappointing to realize I have to continue to pay for this device forever.4. Possible not related to just the \"Ring\" company, but my hope was when I purchased this item was that as somebody rings the doorbell, that video would immediately show on the \"Alexa Show\" device so I know who is at the door?  Not possibly with this doorbell, haven\\'t figured out if that works with a different doorbell.  You can ask Alexa to show me the front door, but by the time it shows, you need to have already answered the door.',\n",
       " 'Although the idea for a video doorbell would make for a revolutionary product, in actual practice, it leaves much to be desired at this time.  It appears to be a well constructed product that should last many years, however, the app (at least on Android devices as I have tested) is very buggy.  I was unable to consistently receive a \"call\" from the doorbell upon the button being pressed consistently.  There are times where the app would \"ring\" within 20 seconds and other times where it would not ring at all.  The latency in time between the moment of the button being pressed and the app responding should ideally be less than 15 seconds IMHO.  Even with a very fast and strong internet connection, this product simply refused to work as advertised in a consistent and reliable manner.As far as the motion detection feature is concerned, there is also an unreasonable amount of latency that is unacceptable.I do have to say that the app itself appears to be reasonably well designed for an early generation product.I truly had high hopes for this product.  Perhaps in version 3 or 4 it will be a product worthy of 5 stars....otherwise I am sure that there would be other competing products that are willing to take up the challenge and succeed where the Ring has utterly failed.I wasn\\'t happy with this Ring video doorbell either. For a relatively pricey product, I would expect it to work as advertized. I have Verizon FiOS 75 Mbs high speed internet, with a wireless N router that was only located about 15 FEET away from where I had my RING installed at my main entry. There is absolutely no excuse for this product to not be able to send out a signal and \"ring\" the app. These days, a product should work \"out of the box\" or it just isn\\'t ready for primetime. I like the innovative promise of a video doorbell, but this is not a product that I can recommend.Also, I find it very doubtful that this RING doorbell battery will keep a charge for 1 year of service. Mine went down nearly 10% in just 3 days....How is that possible?',\n",
       " \"I bought this after my dog became deaf & could no longer let me know when someone was knocking on my door(LOL). I live alone & it is comforting to be able to see what is going on before I open the door & also know when I out on my back deck that someone is at the front door. I only had the doorbell for a week when I was at work & a woman rang my bell because my father had been at my house & my one dog accidently got outside the fence & after he left was sitting on my stoop. I was able to confirm with the woman via the video feed while I was at work that it was my dog & she put her into back yard for m.The only problem I have is my door is maybe six feet from the sidewalk & I live right near a high school so it goes off all the time for 'motion'. You can adjust for how far the motion sensor goes out but I can't make it small enough to not be triggered by kids on the sidewalk or even larger vehicles driving by.I have had some difficulty with a neighbor & am grateful when I can see it is him at the door & I just don't answer but can also keep an eye on him leaving my property.\",\n",
       " \"So this thing looks great. The app is easy to use, and I was able to force live view by switching to a new version of the app even though I run mine on battery only. But the lag.... it's awful. By the time I get the notification, no one is there. I can walk to my door, dig for my keys, unlock it, and my phone starts buzzing as I'm walking in. You have to go around a corner to get to my door, but there's still a walk to get up to the door itself. I will frequently have an alert that someone rang the doorbell instead of letting me know that there's movement where someone is approaching. I wish I had known how bad it would be.\",\n",
       " 'This has turned out to be a poor purchase. It worked great for maybe the first 2-3 months minus some adjustments for the multiple motion alerts I was receiving. But after those couple of months I’ve had nothing but issues. Live view rarely will pull up. Motion alerts show me nothing but a black screen when reviewed and if I try to answer the doorbell through my phone it is completely useless. It will not load the camera. All software is up to date, the connection is strong. Unfortunately I’ve seen way too many similar posts and reviews and I really wish I had purchased a different brand. The purpose of this doorbell being security is completely lost. It’s nothing more than a $100 doorbell. I will begin checking reviews on the Nest doorbell and hope it is a more reliable unit to replace my Ring with.',\n",
       " 'Have owned this product now almost a year and a half.  There are good and bad things about this.  First -- you really do need a rather good internet in order to really run this thing.  Standard, sub-15 megabit internet gives this item issues.  Runs excellent on 100 Megabit AT&T Fiber, and now has an upgrade that, even without being hard-wired you can still see \"on demand.\"  If you plan to wire this to your house, be prepared to hire an electrician who is familiar with the doorbell.  Customer service is good, but only for basic, routine things that you should be able to handle yourself without calling them in the first place.  They couldn\\'t get this thing hardwired.  Occasionally the doorbell will lose connection or the battery will go from 30 percent power to 0 percent power within a matter of minutes, but overall the positives of this doorbell providing the security it promises is unmistakable.  Knowing these issues, I probably still would have bought the product, although the price of the product NOW is more competitive than the price I paid a year and a half ago (I almost didn\\'t buy it).  Having Ring Neighborhoods on the phone is a very handy tool so that people can see which solicitors are going around the neighborhood and to ID package thieves during the holiday season.  Still not a 5-star product, but I\\'m not sure I expected it to be.',\n",
       " 'I bought two of these doorbells because I have two different doors. I have input voltage of 24VAC going to these (though it is not necessary since you can charge them via USB). However, one of the two doorbells died after only a 3 months and tripped my input voltage circuit. It smells like it burned up inside the doorbell.By the way, I also bought two chimes for inside the house.For the doorbell that works, about 1/4 of the time, I hear nothing inside the house on the chimes and do not get alerts on my phone. Another 1/4 of the time, the doorbell chime rings incessantly in the house as if the button is stuck. The other 1/2 of the time, the doorbell rings properly. However, every single time I answer a call, the reception is so terrible that I cannot hear the person and they cannot hear me. I have perfect broadband internet with perfect wifi signal, so this is not an issue on my end.Essentially, I use this one doorbell as a regular old doorbell except that I can be alerted on my phone which is nice to know. If someone brings a package at least I can tell a neighbor to grab it if I am away. Other than that, the calling system of the doorbell is totally useless, and even the alert portion of the feature set is pretty spotty at best.Oh, I forgot one thing. For both of my doorbells, the little metal button plate actually fell right off. One of them I was able to find and superglue back on. The other I could not find.I am disappointed. I have wasted almost $500 on the two doorbells and the two chimes.',\n",
       " 'I considered this a security feature for my safety, and my possessions. It records movement and rings, and saves it to the cloud. I gave access to a close friend so she could check the feed, in case something happened to me.  It\\'s $3/mo to back up the video, but useful if you ever need evidence of harassment. It gave me peace of mind. There are other perks!  If you are taking a nap and the doorbell rings, you can check the video and if it\\'s unimportant, go back to sleep!  If I\\'m at work, I can tell package delivery to just leave it at the door.  Now there is a function for \"live view\", so if my dogs bark at something, I can check what they are barking about. Or if I hear something in the middle of the night I can check the front of my house and go back to sleep. There is now a \"community\" option, where you can view posts from a certain radius from your home. People post suspicious activity with their video feed.

       " \"I have been frustrated with this Doorbell since I originally purchased it 6 or 7 month ago. My house has an  older intercom system that allowed you to speak to the front door from any room in the house. The same system broadcast the front doorbell to each room as well. Once I hooked this doorbell up to the intercom's power line. (I had to build a box, stucco and paint it to match the surround),  and purchased a 2.5 wi fi extender because it doesn't work on my, or any, 5.0 extender, this doorbell would inexplicably trigger in the middle of the night! Once the bell started ringing it wouldn't stop, in every room of the house, until I physically disconnected the outside unit. (try doing that at two in the morning) Strange that it always would start ringing well after midnight and never stopped. The motion activated video showed that no one was pranking me. I thought my house was haunted. After 3-4 efforts to rewire it and attach that little diode thing that it comes with, to various screws, I finally gave up and went to battery power. The battery has to be recharged at least once a month and all the constant removal and reattachment resulted in one of the safety screws becoming completely stripped in the screwed down position. You cant replace these screws with any common screw type. Its a tiny hex head. So now, the doorbell does not fit flush anymore because the stripped screw blocks it from proper flush mounting. I also don't recall ever getting any warnings that it was about to go dead on battery power until I noticed I stopped getting motion alerts to my phone. Once dead and re-charged, you have to go through the whole process of trying to re-sync to your phone. That in itself is a huge pain. So much so that I completely gave up on it about two months ago. I also bought the separate ringer for $30 but it is so quiet that you don't know the bell is ringing unless you are in the room where you plugged in the ringer or you have your phone in your pocket. I don't know about you but I don't carry my cell phone around my house. I would go back to my old intercom system but I would have to rip out the stuccoed box, repair and repaint the wall outside. The whole ownership process has been so exhausting that the Ring doorbell now just sits out there, dead as a door . . .  well . . . you know. It might still have some security function since any smart burglar should be able to recognize it upon approach and I typically know in advance when someone I am expecting should be coming to my door. Also, my dogs will start barking when someone starts banging on the door so that is my current system.\",\n",
       " \"I LOVE RING....yes I am yelling!  I started with the original Ring almost 2 years ago after seeing an old Shark Tank episode with Dorbot. I am not able to hard wire due to my recessed door frame so I relied on the battery.  When the Ring 2 came out with the ability to swap batteries without removing it I was all in.  I just recently set it up and it's better than expected.  I love being able to check in live.  Even though I don't need a doorbell at my back door I think I am going to set up the original ring just for security.  I had a strange visitor at my home one day when I was home and it was great being able to see before opening the door.  Also with doing screen shots of the video I was able to share it with neighbors on the Nextdoor app.  One who is retired law enforcement said it was the best video quality he has ever seen and couldn't believe it was from my doorbell and that was with the original Ring.  We've all seen the horrible videos from robberies where all you can make out is the person's shape and clothing.  The Ring video is so clear people could identify what kind of car he had in my driveway which is a good 30 feet from my door. The quality on Ring 2 is even better. I've had multiple people ask me about it after my post and many have since purchased at least one. A friend who has 4 homes installed them at all locations even though he has video surveillance because of how easy the app is to use. People at work are always asking about it and can't believe how great it is.  I think I may be one of your best advertisements.  I have purchase a couple as Christmas gifts for family members as well. I have needed to contact support and the reps are wonderful.  The charger connection corroded on my first Ring and I was sent a replacement right away.  Great product and a great company!\",\n",

I can do a live view to see if anything is going on.I can see and talk to that person at the door while at home or away from through my cell phone. It sends immediate notifications soon as it rings or motion ddetected.You can allow up to five or six family members that same access so that they can see whose there before answering the door.However, this is important to know. This company will allow you 30 days to view and review your recording without a payment plan.The plans are cheap $3 dollars a month or $30 a year and free to for live viewing only but to go back and look at the recording you must select a plan. Keep in mind if someone breaks into your home, a live view will not help the police but a recorded reviewed will because it will show the video of that person. A live view will on show real time with recording.My home was broken into through the front door. If I had this product then. I could have gotten the recording. The video shows pretty clear. It works for me. It has night vision. However, I hear the newer versions of ring has a better camera.\",\n",
       " 'Updated 12/18/2017:Decided to upgrade to the Ring Pro. Experienced a problem with the basic Ring related to power consumption. Even though hardwired, the primary source of power appears to be the battery, which is depleted quickly with frequent motion alerts and frequent use of \"live view\". The battery should be able to continually charge, but apparently it wasn\\'t charging fast enough. Experienced \"poor\" signal strength and weak battery. Ring customer support is very responsive by phone and email.Purchased the Ring (basic) video doorbell from an Amazon third-party seller. We had just returned the Skybell after a very brief and unfortunate experience, including a lack of Skybell customer service. Ring seemed like the only other inexpensive option. I’m probably going to be disappointed when the 30 day free trial of video storage expires, but overall, Ring is doing exactly what we wanted. It was very easy to set up and the instructions were accurate. The set up takes place before attaching the unit to the wall. That was a good idea and we were able to test the video and bell before installing it. We hardwired it to an existing doorbell, but there is a built in battery that is said to last about a year, so this is a good option for locations without an existing doorbell. I have the motion range set nearly to the maximum and have received alerts only when someone is on the property, in the driveway, or at the door. It has not been triggered by activity at the next door neighbor’s property, which is actually within video view, but outside of the set motion range. It also hasn’t been triggered by street activity. The motion detection is perfect so far. Some reviews have said that the connection is too slow to see people when they’re approaching, but that’s not been our experience. We are alerted as soon as there is nearby activity and the video seems to be in real time. The sound quality is also good. Not perfect, but more than adequate for a doorbell. Video and audio quality may be related to having high speed internet and a whole house mesh network to cover outside devices. I wish the video storage was free. Even if it was only for a few days of storage. That would be long enough to review video in the event of a problem. I don’t plan to subscribe to video storage. The app is very basic. It would be nice if the chime could be changed. There’s a volume control, but no ability to change the sound. My husband is partially deaf and he doesn’t always hear the chime’s particular tone. I rated it as four stars because of the inability to change the chime and because there’s no free, temporary video storage.',\n",
       " \"Didn't even last a year, I am very disappointed. It kind of worked for the first couple of months. Problem is, when someone would ring it, I couldn't ever understand what they were saying because the audio would cut in and out, and the person on the other side couldn't understand what I was saying for the same reason. After having this for 8 months It has only worked flawlessly twice. That's right, there were only 2 times that it actually worked as advertised where both parties could clearly tell what the other was saying. The reason I even gave it 2 stars is because at least it would record stuff. That part worked 90 percent of the time. When someone would press the ring button, it would ring on my phone about 50% of the time, so half the time I would hear someone at the door at least. I bought this in May 2016. By December 2016 the ring part would never ring on my phone so people ringing my bell would just walk off because I never knew when someone was ringing my bell. I would at least see the video though. By Jan. 2017, it just turned into a brick. Tried to un-sync, re-sync, charge up full. It just wont work, A $200 brick. I have had issues with arlo cameras as well, but at least I could get those back running. I think I jumped on the smart camera/house bandwagon too early. I mainly wanted to monitor my house, but my arlo cameras handle that (as long as we don't have a power outage cause it needs to be on a stupid wifi connection to work!!). Will maybe try something else for the front door because this thing does not work. Maybe just wait a few years until this technology improves a bit. I regret that I bought my mom one. I had told her that it only kind of works, but if she didn't open the box yet, I will see if I can send it back for a refund and get her something else. She also has had problems with arlo cameras and will no doubt have problems with this as the tech is just not all there yet. Buy this stuff if you have money to blow and maybe don't mind buying another one every 3 months as the functionality slowly deteriorates over time until you end up with a $200 brick. I hate this.\",\n",
       " \"So this thing was great for about 8 days.  Now it won't connect to my wifi.  Even if I place the unit right next to the router.  I will call Ring again today for more tech support but something tells me I will be sending this backUpdate:  I returned the first one only to have the same issue with the second one.

The picture is not as clear as we would like it to be unless a person is standing still in front of the bell, but it does give us a much better view than nothing.  Our bigger problem has been with hooking it up to our doorbell.  We have a digital doorbell which started ringing continually once we hooked it up.  We were told our unit was not compatible.  We were told they would email us a list, which they never did.  We looked on line and found a list of compatible doorbell units, picked one and hooked it up.  Again, the doorbell would ring randomly and sometimes for several minutes straight.  We called customer assistance and were told they had no idea why that would happen and they would call us back - over 2 weeks ago.  I don\\'t think they\\'re going to call.  We have now purchased yet another doorbell and have not yet hooked it up.  We were also very disappointed when, at the 30 day mark, we found we can no longer look at motion or rings unless they \"pop-up\" on our phones.

She indicated that she had reviewed the video I had previously sent and agreed that this was not the type of experience that they wanted their customers to have with their products, and arranged for me to exchange my unit for an upgraded unit better suited to my application.  The call was pleasant, quick and designed to resolve my concerns.  The new unit was shipped that day and arrived in three days, with notifications along the way.  Installation was easy, and the Advocate was available to answer any questions I had.  The new product works very well and I am pleased with the video quality and other features.  My review for the original product was 2-stars, and I don\\'t know if this was the product or I received a defective unit.  What I do know is that the Ring Neighbor Advocate Team saw that they had an unhappy customer and worked quickly to change that.  For that reason, and the fact that the new unit is working well, I am changing my review to 5-stars.***Purchased the unit in December 2018 and I have never been able to get video even close to 720P.  The unit responds fairly quickly, live-view works, audio works, and video works  -  kind of.  The quality of the recordings is so pixelated even in full daylight that you can\\'t even recognize faces.  Everything else is OK (bandwidth, wi-fi signal strength, upload speeds, video settings, etc.).I uploaded a video to Customer Support, and he agreed that the video was very poor.  The Customer Support rep was polite, and tried to walk me through the standard steps (check wi-fi strength, reset the unit, etc.) but eventually said that because his records showed the unit was working as it should, there was nothing that he could do - but he did try to up-sell me to their \"Pro\" unit.  If I can\\'t even get advertised 720 performance out of this unit and tech support can\\'t resolve the issue, why would I purchase another Ring Product?  My Blink camera in the same location works just fine, and so I guess I\\'ll just need to wait for the Blink Video doorbell to be released.',\n",

Literally everything you need comes with this doorbell for installation - easy written and video instructions for wiring direct to your existing doorbell or it works great screwing it to the outside of the house - we have weak wifi and it still works very well. We got funny video of a delivery driver talking smack about our dog barking. You get a 30 days of free video storage - after that it's only $3 a month or $30 for the entire year which we will most likely sign up for.

It’s either notifying me 24/7 for a bug flying in the street or not notifying me until somebody is halfway through the door- it costs $30 annually for service. A small price to pay for peace of mind IMHO- audio quality is trash- there’s no trigger for night vision. There’s a streetlight directly across from our ring and for the first month it didn’t bother the ring. Now suddenly it’s a problem?? It never goes into night vision now.- customer support can’t actually do anything except forward complaints to the development team. I’m starting to think I got taken..',\n",

Someone has to come right up to the porch before the picture is good enough, but usually it's delayed and pixelated.  Not worth $30/year subscription you have to pay if you want to view the video, because there's no way you can catch it live and have this for free.On Ring's FB site, lots of complaints today.  Before I could add mine, Ring had deleted the customer post and the avalanche of replies backing it up.  Here's mine:  So many people having the same issues!

       " 'It looks nice and trendy, has simple installation instructions and kind of works, but needs a lot more work to get it right.  I say two stars and not one simply because of the innovative ideas.  Hopefully, they fix all of their problems in the next version of the device.Now, to all of the serious issues with our Ring doorbell which no call to tech support is going to solve:1) You can set and save how far the motion detector works and even set the zones/sectors it will detect.  However, if I reduce it to the bare minimum, it still picks up traffic on the street which is about 50 ft away.  I had to turn off the motion sensor to keep my sanity because the thing goes off every 10 minutes whenever we have heavy traffic.  Huge problem since the motion detector is one of the main features of the device.2) This doorbell has to authenticate with the server which sometimes takes seconds before it actually starts taking video. This is a problem on the back end and we have no control over how long authentication takes, no matter how fast our internet connection is. So, we get video of nothing most of the time.  Doesn\\'t matter, probably was just a car driving by... see number 1.3) The doorbell is large, so if your wall is not perfectly flat, then you\\'ll have the screws that mount to the wall showing.  Yeah, I can fix that with extra time and money, but they should have thought of that when designing such a large fixture.  All they needed to do was add a shroud that fits around the doorbell to hide the gap or a flexible spongy backside on the mount (think yoga mat),4) The Ring software for some reason won\\'t save my house location even though it says it\\'s been saved.  Every time I open up the app, I get an annoying location of \"Lompoc, CA\".  I don\\'t live anywhere near there!5) Our house is stucco on the outside, so we had to drill large holes to fit anchors and mount the device.  Wouldn\\'t be that big of a problem if the doorbell actually delivered, but in our case it\\'s not all that.  So, to remove it, I\\'ll have to patch the wall and somehow match the paint in a highly visible area the will detract from curb appeal if I get it wrong  I\\'m leaving the doorbell there as a trendy fixture.',\n",

Things that you should be aware of before buying it....This particular item will not show you a live view, you need to order the pro for that, but still works great on picking up any motion in the area you designate...You may want to order the chime along with this, or you will not be able to hear the doorbell if your phone is on silent...  Lastly although you can recharge the battery, it seems to lose charge very fast.  I fully charged mine yesterday and just 24 hours later, it's already only at 88 percent.  The brochure will tell you the battery will last 6-12 months, so i'm finding that hard to believe.  I'm hoping this is due to everyone in my house wanting to test it throughout the day.  The good thing is that you can check your battery life from your phone or computer, so you are able to recharge it before it goes dead.  In the pictures, I took the night view at 9 pm, with very low light in my area.  However when testing it to see what I wanted to do with the interior of the garage it is very hard to see anything when there is low lighting.

       " \"I've never been so impressed with a delivered product.  This thing was bubble wrapped perfectly. The item itself came with every single thing you need.  Even a mini level, it was so cute.  Instructions were easy to follow and it was extremely professional in it's packaging and product.  I was blown away.  I set it up to my wifi through the app.  This is where a problem came in.  Once it was set up and I was testing it in my garage the picture was so blown up and white you could hardly see and my app was not working.  It would spin and freeze up on me which was a major disappointment.  I have a Note 5 so it should be a good enough phone, right?  Well, my son, being an apple junky downloaded the app to his phone and what do you know? The dang thing worked perfectly other than the blown up image.  I was worried I'd have to send it back and debated exchanging it for the pro so I could have a better quality picture.The next day, I decided to hook it up first and test it out from there.  It was a simple set up, removing my old (actually new since last year) doorbell and hooking the wires to the plate.  I attached the doorbell to the plate, and no doorbell.  My son was KIND enough to remind me to turn the power back on. LOL.  Brain fog moment.  I did as he suggested, lol (him laughing the whole time) and tried out my new Ring doorbell.  I immediately got an alert and of course my phone would not view it so my son happily showed him the picture from his phone and the clarity was great!  Not blown up like it was in my garage.  I'm assuming that was due to all the lighting.  We were able to talk to each other which was awesome.I also discovered that I could download the app on my windows 10 computer which I immediately did and perfect clarity.  Well, my hubby said Christmas was coming early for me and I can upgrade to the new note 8 since this doorbell was super important to me.  I'm often running inside the house to check my door when my rude dogs think every person walking buy is a danger and on our property even if their yards away.  Now I can conveniently check my computer first or my phone, which decided to start working after my Christmas gift was revealed, of course.I'll still need that 8 because....well....it's got a better camera, you know.  lol.  I do have difficulty with the app working at times on all devices as it will sometimes take a while to upload.  I found going straight to live view solves that issue 9 times out of 10.  I can still hit the green phone button to utilize the speakers.  Don't forget to hit the red phone button when your done talking or the UPS guy will still hear your conversation which is kind of embarrassing. LOL.  I learned that the hard way.I wish the clarity were a bit better but having said that I do have solid images and it's really pretty good for the price.  Not sure doubling the price for a hair better quality would be worth it or not.  Maybe later down the road I'll get the upgrade.  I would really love the latest and greatest but nearly $500 made me choke on my saliva.  I'm very happy with my purchase, would highly recommend, and I no longer have to get the unwanted exercise of running to my front door every time the dog barks.  I will be paying for the cloud service, after all, we do need it to record or what's the point, right?  But 3$ a month is doable.  Don't think I need the 10$ package.P.S.  If I remember (brain fog) I'll try to update when I get my new phone and let you know if the app works better on it or not!  Love the product!\",\n",
       " \"I was glad for the LiveView feature, which I was initially disappointed to learn it didn't have when I first bought it, so adding it was a plus.  However, the motion-feature is too slow to detect, as others have commented (it shows people walking away or sometimes there's nothing to show!), it's performance is not optimal, hence not the most reliable.My biggest gripe by far is the battery life.  My house doesn't have a built-in door bell, hence no doorbell wiring so I appreciated the battery feature of ring.  But that's where my 'appreciation' ends.  Ring's official statement is that you could get up to 6 months of use but weather affects it (cold mostly, and perhaps hot too).  After I heard the 6 month time frame, I mentally adjusted my expectation to say 3-4 months, but I've gotten 4 weeks at best!  It was definitely worse during the winter (had to charge every week or so), but it's now July and I charged the battery on July 5th, and then got a warning about 2 days ago that it's critically low so less than 3 weeks?  I am yet to go past 4 weeks without having to recharge it.  So the 6 month time frame Ring gives is disingenuous at best, and dishonest at the least.  If others have been able to get up to 6 months out of theirs running on battery, I'd love to know what part of the country (or the world) you live and what you've managed to do.  And yes, I've adjusted the motion zones, sensitivity and everything I reasonably could (for instance, the bell rings for push events only, not for motion), and still get very crappy battery performance.  I'm glad I have this somewhat inexpensive motion-based camera, but Ring has either got to put more effort in a more reliable battery or battery-operated performance or not sell it with the battery option at all, because the biggest nuisance of this is having to charge so often.  Imagine if when I really need the features the most is when it is indoors charging.  It is also not a reasonable expense or effort to install door bell wiring just for this and I certainly will look for a wired product (and a house with wiring) when I move to my next house but geez.\",\n",
       " \"I purchased this for my father who spends a lot of time in his home office and often doesn't hear people at the door.  It was his father's day gift.  He wasn't exactly sure what it was until I installed it for him and showed him.  He loves it!  He usually has his cell phone near by and the fact this uses his cell is convenient for him.I opened the box and made sure it had all of the tools and parts needed to install.  The unit arrived with the battery at 45% charge.  I downloaded the app for his phone and used it to connect the doorbell to his home network.  It took me about 4 minutes to get it paired.  The Ring app walked me through it which made it nice and easy.Once the unit was connected to his home wifi network, I found a place to install it.  The front of his house is rock which worried me at first.  But there were instructions for mounting on rock.  In the app, you choose how, were and on what surface you are going to install the unit and it brings up the right videos to walk you through the process.  I chose to mount it near the old doorbell to use the wires for a hard wired system.  I attached the level and put the back plate where it was going to go.  I marked the holes with a pencil then drilled the holes using the included drill bit.  Including the drill bit was a nice touch.  Many products tell me what size bit to use but I have never seen one included.  After I drilled the 4 holes, I inserted the plastic pieces.  I removed the level and put the back plate against the wall and inserted the screws.After the back plate was installed I simply put the doorbell on the back plate and slide it down on the hooks.  I tightened the two screws on the bottom to lock it in place.  That was it.We mounted it about 4 feet off the ground which worried me at first that it wouldn't catch people's faces.  After testing it I realized that was a good height.  My face is perfectly visible on the phone screen.  We did not experience any delay when talking to people at the front door from the basement.  It was loud and clear on both ends.I definitely recommend this item to anybody who doesn't always hear people at the door and could use their phone with this product.  My dad is also pretty happy about the security it provides when he is away.  He plans to talk to people as if he was home but couldn't immediately answer the door.\",\n",
       " 'Obviously the ring is a great idea in theory, and when it works, it works. However, WiFi connectivity issues (using a $400 nighthawk router on spectrum ultimate that is literally 5ft away from doorbell) and battery run time are huge drawbacks. I have the ring floodlight as well, (basically a $300 floodlight) and the only reason I’m giving the doorbell 2 stars is because I have to admit their customer service does try hard to please their customers. My floodlight failed, and they did send me a replacement pretty quick, (although the replacement was also defective and the issue still hasn’t been resolved) so I commend them for at least making the effort. The battery operated ring falls victim to the same WiFi connectivity issues as the floodlight and the battery simply just doesn’t last. Obviously the newer model, with removable batteries might be the way to go, but I’m apprehensive to try until they get the WiFi bugs worked out. Also, like everyone else has mentioned, the motion detection could use a lot of work, more often than not, the ring starts recording AFTER the person is already walking away.',\n",

If I could just figure out how to completely turn them off.....  :)  Guess I need to contact customer support. What I like the most is being able to talk to my dogs when I'm not home & they are in the yard. Their reaction is priceless! They wonder where Momma's voice is coming from.

Secondly, the when the bell is wrong, and I attempt to answer it works on and off, some times it works some times it doesn’t, some times I don’t even get the notification till after, it is not a connection problem since I have tested my WiFi speeds multiple times and it has no issues with any other devices in the house, furthermore the bell is no more than 5ft from the router. Last but not least, the back of the ring came with dust and scratches and the two security screws lose in the box, which with fair certainty probably means this product was used, I chose to install because the motion sensor and notifications work which was my main concern due to the next few day me needing to keep an eye at the house, but I’m certainly not 100% satisfied.For the good:Motion sensor notification, and brief recordings of such and of bell rings works with absolutely no issues, it really does give an extra sense of security and it’s ideal for any and all parents.

The second problem is I live on a main street in my community and it catches every single car that passes by. I was getting anywhere from 10-20 alerts a day, even with the setting on light. I spent countless hours on the phone with their customer service changing settings, but ultimatley nothing worked. I was hopeful when one of the Ring representatives told me to add washers. I added the washers and it barley helped. I have to say I am very disappointed in this product. So, I am sad to say that I would not recommend this product.

First,  we order a lot of things online and it isn\\'t always convenient to answer the door for deliveries at the exact moment items are delivered.  RING allows us to see and even communicate with delivery drivers without always actually having to go to the door immediately.  It is also quite helpful to have this product because there is no storm door between us and the visitor at the door.  It makes me feel much safer to be able to choose whether I want to stand face to face at the door with a stranger.CONS:  The one drawback I have found to RING VIDEO DOORBELL is that ours is so sensitive that even when motion distance is set at a minimum, it picks up the movement of our neighbor\\'s car as it enters or leaves his driveway all too often.  This is because the area past our front door on that side of the house is very open and the yards are small.

I told myself if they ever fixed my complaints, I\\'d revisit this review.Almost 12 months later, I dusted off the box and TRIED again. I again contacted Ring\\'s Customer Service, and this time, a new agent, Jeffrey, was able to get it working AS I WANTED IT TO. Part of his method was to send me a NEW doorbell (lifetime warranty) and introduce me to new products that they invented. (I wonder if they invented those new products because of my 2016 complaints). Spacers now allow me to adjust the doorbell angle downward by 5°, 10° or 15°. They also created a solar charger. They effectively answered all of my complaints.I am very happy to change my rating to FIVE STARS. The 2018 version of the Ring Wi-Fi enabled Video Doorbell is a vast improvement over their 2016 doorbell, and INFINITELY better than my old (boring) doorbell. I would give Jeffrey TEN stars if I could.LATE 2017 SUMMARY:I finally decided to try again, got out the bell, recharged the battery, but it wouldn\\'t work at all this time, so I e-mailed Customer Support. Jeffrey wrote back then called me and held my hand every step of the way. He diagnosed that I had a bad doorbell, sent me a replacement unit for free, even though it had been almost 12 months since purchase, and we got it working. When I continued to have occasional alerts from passing cars, he sent me some wedges to try, which cured that problem; and when I worried about how often I\\'d have to charge the battery, he made sure I got a solar charger to try.The unit at 15° detected some cats walking across my porch, so I now have it at 10° and it works great. I have it aimed at a 45° angle with a neighbor-made bracket from last year. At 10° and with my car parked where it is, I don\\'t get any passing car alerts.  It recognizes people when they get to my steps. This doorbell is well worth FIVE STARS.A year ago, I said that if they could fix these problems, and especially make it less likely to \"see\" cars and not require me to charge the battery anywhere near as often; that I\\'d upgrade my rating. Well, they did. The new unit is better quality, they invented angle spacers to not recognize cars as much, and they came up with a solar charger which (even though my house faces north) is getting enough ambient light to not discharge much during winter. I look forward to summer charging when the morning sun will come in under the porch on my north side door.Thank you, Jeffrey, for AMAZING customer service.IMAGES:0. Not shown: When Doorbell was mounted at 0° (default position), I occasionally detected a car on the street 40 feet from the door.1. When I mounted the doorbell at a 15° downward angle, it occasionally gave me motion alerts for cats crossing the porch. Cat\\'s image used without cat\\'s permission.2. Not shown: Since I remounted it at a 10° downward angle, it has not told me about any cats, nor has it told me of any cars. I believe I have struck a happy medium.',\n",
       " 'I purchased this gadget for my daughter. After downloading the app and following the simple set up instructions, we had no luck activating it. An error message “An error occurred trying to perform the operation. Try later again” was repeatedly displayed.After returning this unit, we ordered a second one, which we were finally able to activate, but within a few hours the inside door chime quit working, but then it worked again.My daughter decided to send us an invitation, so that we can be also connected through our cell phones. After accepting the invitation, entering my name and creating our own password, a message “Thre was a problem accepting the invitation. Please try again later” has popped up an we weren’t able to complete the connection.Despite of our disappointment, we plan keep it for a couple of more weeks and then I’ll decide.My final comments: The consumer rating shows an 11% reject rate, which is horrible. The concept is very good, but the quality is way bellow industry standard. Just another unreliable electronic gadget.',\n",
       " 'I was expecting that the Ring Doorbell will be a great addition to our home security system but I was disappointed because it is not that good considering I have a lot of false motion detection notification event I have adjusted it to the desired sensitivity. All it detects are cars passing by our street even we are about 30 feet or more from the street.I know they will replace the doorbell if it’s been stolen as long as there’s a Police report, but they should include an antitheft bracket for added security.The first Ring that I received has a smudge on the box, it looks like someone is taking their snack and packing this at the same time. I did return this due to the video was blurred and it has been replaced by a used one. You can see in the photos that it is definitely been used and then returned for some reasons and then shipped to me.I just installed it because it was working and the video is clear. I hope Amazon should have done a better job in selling brand new products not a refurbished or returned used items.',\n",
       " \"Then you will not be disappointed.Cons:But common sense should also tell you that you will not have always-on live video if you rely on the battery and do not have a wired installation.For fast response and good quality video you need a STRONG wifi connection. The recommended NETGEAR N300 Wi-Fi Range Extender, Essentials Edition (EX2700). Works fine and is inexpensive.You will most likely be wanting to add their cloud storage and the charge is per Ring door or camera device.When the Heat Index is over 100 degrees, the Ring seems to have some problems detecting motion . . . since the background is warmer than the person approaching?Plus:While the manual and online help is good, it is a complicated device, BUT the....Biggest plus is if you have any installation or setup problem, call Ring. They will talk you through it. You will get a US based, English speaking, well trained and friendly technical support person. So, forget your ego and save a lot of time and CALL for assistance.Battery operated on a door that gets a lot of Motion triggers per day still has 40% charge after 3.5 months. Other two Rings are at 95% after 1 month and 80% after 2.5 months.It works great with my iPhones.While all phones share the same Ring devices, each phone and app installation needs its own Ring account.If you have a problem setting up multiple phones...CALL.I have 3 up and operating fine. 2 needed wifi range extenders, not to work, but to work excellently.Alert:Buy sold by Amazon or Ring.Trying to save a few $ buying 3rd party might get you a not really new device. I don't mean just open box, but a unit someone installed and repackaged and returned.I gave it 5 stars even with those cons because they are all things you should have read about before deciding to buy, and most are also just common sense, if you think about it. Ring does not slap you in the face to get you to see its limitations, but they don't hide them from you either.\",\n",
       " 'I had the system for a couple weeks now and finally got around to having it installed. Personally, I was ready to install the day I received it but waited since I had to adjust the area where it would be installed - the surface area would not have allowed it to fit flush. Another reason for the delay was the hard wire. Waiting for someone to make these change, I chiseled the surface area myself and again waited for my son for the wire part. After watching him do the wire piece I realize I could have done this myself.At first, the motion was not picking up as I thought. 16 hours later, I\\'m getting notified each time a car drives by- I can adjust the range to fix that. As I view the other products I realize there is one offered that\\'s somewhat slimmer but a little more than I want to pay - I can deal with this one for now. Overall, easy to install seems to function as described. And after subscribing to the plan, I see there are several people in my neighborhood that have Ring. I read several reviews before actually \"pushing the button\". And almost didn\\'t make the purchase. Today, I am glad I did and pray the future experience will justify the 5-star. (as of May 30)June 22, 2018 - Since installing, there was one issue with the inside chime stop working. At first, it worked great. and all of a sudden it stopped. Ring still came through on the cell phone, but if anyone rings the doorbell, and you were home, you would not hear the chime. Called CS, and we walked through checking if the wires came to lose and sure enough one had.  Inside chime working perfectly! Still, hold a 5 star in my book.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve had this now for a couple of weeks and am very pleased.  I was a little apprehensive buying this after seeing so many reviews of false positives from passing cars and pedestrians.  But as I read the instructions, I realized that since you had to come up a few steps to get to my porch,  my placement was going to be higher than the 48\" recommended in the documentation.  So I did a little research and bought a wedge kit.  I used two wedges to give my self a good angle and the only false positive I\\'ve had was the garbage truck picking up my trash from the curb.  Ironically,  it has missed picking up the mailman a couple of times, but I can\\'t seem to recreate the issue with any other delivery persons or visitors, so I suspect he is an alien in disguise.  (more likely his uniform blends in with the bright backgrond).  I\\'ve been very pleased with the unit overall.',\n",
       " 'So that you know:- This will accept only 1 ring action at a time. The visitor at the door has to wait few seconds (approx 60 seconds) before to ring again.- The motion alert is missing some events. It looks like there is an idle time between the motion captures. If two motions happen within 5 minutes or so, it will capture only the first one and eventually missing the following motions.- Using it for monitoring will prevent you to get alerts. I setup my old tablet in the kitchen to show me the front door Ring Doorbell. After doing this, I couldn’t get any ring or motion alerts on all the connected devices including the chimes/phone/tablet. So you either stream the video and eventually miss all the alerts or close the app to get them.- Wasn’t able to get a good WiFi signal in just few feet away from the second floor, I have purchased a $60 WiFi extender that I installed near the door to get it to work.- the alerts are delivered only through push notifications (No email or Message support) and the online account activity is not immediately updated when there is an event.- You may have to wait few minutes to see a recorded motion online, depending on both your mobile and Ring internet connection speed . It would be practical to get a video preview such as 3 pictures taken during the motions, while the video is uploading. This may help detect false alarm rapidly.- There is a $3 monthly subscription required for video replay features.- It’s good for starters but I’ll be definitely looking for better and subscription free products in the market unless we get a major updates.',\n",
       " 'I needed a doorbell. I didn’t want to hire an electrician, and battery driven ones in the past have been useless. I also thought a camera and “talk thru the glass” would be useful so we wouldn’t have to open the door to a stranger. I am on a retirement income, so the “home security” systems with a monthly fee were not attractive.I read about many devices. Ring seemed to fit the bill at an attractive price. What a disappointment it is. When motion, or a ring, is detected, it makes an annoying sound. But unless you are holding your phone in your hand (I’m not a teenager who walks about glued to my phone) with the app “up” it doesn’t keep the view long enough to see what or who is there.You need the “Ring Protect” plan - yep, a monthly fee. Not expensive, but a fee. I DON’T NEED any more monthly bills!  I didn’t want that.So I’m stuck with $100 spent on a relatively useless device. Didn’t need that either.The “pros” if you are still interested: 1) it holds a charge for a fairly long time; 2) the people at Ring are very friendly, helpful, and prompt to respond - the first device I received was defective and they replaced it quickly with little bother on my part. Wish it were really what I wanted.',\n",
       " \"UPDATED 6-16-2016In response to my review, I was contacted by Ring customer service (Danielle).  I was really pleased with her desire and willingness to try to help.  We did multiple fixes via email and she was able to look at my devices and monitor them.  Her conclusion was that there was a problem with my WIFI network.  She recommended getting an Eero mesh networking device and offered a 6 month free trial after which I would purchase the Eero at a $100 discount.  I started to go this route but then decided that I might be throwing good money after bad and I really did not want to redo all of my network system just to make the doorbell work.  Basically I gave up and Ring was good enough to let me return the original doorbell.  I bought a refurb doorbell from Amazon.  First one did not work, but the second one seems to be functioning at the moment.Kudos to Danielle for great customer service.  If my refurb does better than the original purchase I will come back with a 5 star review update.Ring devices are horribly unreliable. The randomly go off line and resetting the router or trying to repair fails.  Then mysteriously, they start working for awhile. This have been my experience with both the doorbell and the wireless floodlight camera.  Their software says they are online when they are not.  I'm so sick and tired of their products given all of the time I have spent troubleshooting and working with their customer support. $400 wasted. Do not buy. And Ring, if you don't like my review, send someone to my house and see if you can get this crap to work reliably.  Jim\",\n",
       " \"While it lacks 5GHz wifi channel support and full 1080p resolution, the standards Ring functions very well. The movement and doorbell ring notifications are very responsive (~1 second). The app is also well designed, intuitive and stable as far as I've used it. Installation was very easy and Ring is gracious enough to provide all the tools as well as super simple wifi setup. I had no issues setting it up or wiring it into my existing doorbell power.Complaints:Unit size: other competitors, including the ring Pro, have smaller form factors which would be nice especially if the batter option is not used or required.Construction: I was a bit disappointed at how fragile the doorbell felt, esp for a device that would live solely outside exposed to the elements. I would have preferred an aluminum construction or heavier duty housing.Responsiveness/Connectivity: the only area where I experienced lag was when attempting to connect to the doorbell via Live View; this takes a good 5 seconds to load (using iPhone 7, AirPort Extreme with >70Mbps down network). Both phone and doorbell have full signal strength.Camera: the biggest disappointments was the video quality. The picture shouldn't be 720p and is always pixelated to some degree, even in favorable lighting. My $75 Foscams have much sharper image quality.Other things to note:- I like the range of accessories and support available- Would have liked if the cloud storage for recordings was free (SkyBell has free storage)- I didn't even know Ring Pro was available until after I purchased! Bummer, would have liked the 5GHz and 1080p option, and smaller form factor.- No other ringtone or doorbell sound options? Really?- I like the security screws, but this thing seems so fragile someone is more likely to smash it than steal it.Overall, a solid product that does what it should and delivers on most fronts, though it doesn't slam dunk in some areas like build quality or video quality. And I feel like it should since this is priced into the Apple product realm of nice-to-have consumer items.\",\n",
       " \"Have used the ring Pro and thus original ring. And both have issues with orbi or networking in general. They seem hit and miss when it comes to connectivity and receiving ringing alert. I also feel the cost for storage is absurd. I've gotten rid of the pro version and I'm likely just going to add Arlo cameras which have voice to notify me and communicate with anyone coming near my doors or my house for that matter.9/11 - this product is pure garbage. Like many folks have reported, when the battery dies live you does not seem to work and in fact the device seems to lose connectivity periodically for no apparent reason. I completely regret the purchase now and I'm looking at other options.\",\n",
       " 'Beware. At first I loved it. That all changed recently. At first would have given it four stars all day long. I have had it for well over a year with success. It all changed a month ago when my application would inexplicably log me out so every time someone would be on my porch or has rung my doorbell, I would have to log in to the application as quickly as possible to answer whom ever was pressing the button. I contacted customer support and they told me to delete the application, restart my phone, and reinstall [of course I had already tried that twice]. This did not help. I called customer service again yesterday and I Spoke to someone that sounded like he had never owned a computer or smart phone and was repeating something from a ring technician handbook. Finally after a long mostly one sided conversation [me being the one side] he somewhat admitted to me that ring had updated the program in their servers to no longer function properly with my iPhone OS. I have an iPhone 6+ that is in perfect condition and I know from experience that if I upgrade to the new OS it will for all practical purposes destroy my phone. It will function very slowly, kill battery life, and the new OS looks terrible and is not as intuitive as it was. Ring expects me to basically buy a new $800+ telephone to continue using their product which I already paid for. Not cool. So much for purchasing something and owning it. Apparently rain owns and controls my doorbell, not me. They can have it back and I would appreciate them to fight back from me although I know that would not happen.',\n",
       " 'This is amazing.  I normally don\\'t post something with a recommendation unless it is literally \"life changing\" The video I am sharing is my wife ringing the doorbell and me at our store.  You can answer the door from anywhere in the world.  You can put it on your smartphone, iphone, ipad, imac, windows pc  (windows 10) to answer the door.  The point being the person at your door does not know where you are.  It works through your Wifi so there is no cost other than $3 a month or $30 for the year if you choose to store your video on a cloud (which I did).  They say that most burglars ring the bell first to see if anyone is home and in researching prior to buying this, most burglars see the ring doorbell and don\\'t even ring it because they know they are being video taped.  It works buy ringing or by motion so if someone decides not to ring the bell, you will still see who it was.  [...]',\n",
       " 'I was really looking forward to having this. Unfortunately, I am disappointed with how it works. It hooks up to WiFi signal well and definitely alerts to movement. Problem is, no matter how close I move the motion detection to my house, it still picks up EVERY SINGLE CAR that drives by all day. I live in a development and so there is quite a bit of traffic and my phone goes off constantly at work. My other complaint is the app! It takes sometimes five minutes or more to load a video of activity and if there happens to be an intruder during one of these hundreds of notifications, I won’t see it until it’s to late! Overall it’s a novel idea, and the concept is good, but the functionality and the app need a LOT of work!! Disappointed for what we spent!',\n",
       " 'I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot the device Amazon sent me. It would complete the setup process, but never connect for a \"Connectivity Test\". The doorbell would always show \"Offline\" in the app, despite sending notifications of motion. If I answered a call or connected when there was motion, audio would not work. Because it showed \"Offline\", Live View was never an option.After trying all troubleshooting available in their help documentation, I connected with Ring support via chat. As I was verifying my account, the Ring Doorbell suddenly connected to the WiFi for the first time! That was short lived - 2 hours later, the WiFi dropped again and I went through several reset attempts, but could never get it to show online again.I thought my issue might be low battery related despite the app showing 47%, so I charged it for several hours. After fully charging, performing another factory reset, and walking through setup again - the battery level never changed. It got stuck in a firmware update loop for several hours.At this point, I reached out to Ring support again and they spent 3+ hours having me troubleshoot and test various combinations of resets and setups including turning off Bluetooth on my phone, deleting the app, restarting my phone, and waiting on updates that took over an hour. One representative led me on for well over 30 minutes providing \"percentage updates\" of 33% and 57%. He also stated that these issues were not as common in the newer models when asked (pretty much admitting that they know this product doesn\\'t live up to the same quality checks as their other models).  Then as I\\'m waiting for the next progress update, he randomly says \"Have a good day!\" and disconnects.I immediately reconnected and was met with a representative that said there were no ways for them to see the progress of an OTA update and that they should never take more than 10 minutes. What!?!All in, I\\'ve spent 3 straight weekends trying to set up a device that after 4 collective hours of Ring support has finally been deemed defective. They\\'ve offered to send a replacement, but also stated \"There is nothing wrong with the model but this device you had was 1 out a tons that had this issue\". I\\'m not certain I\\'m willing to relive their nightmarish support again though if this replacement doesn\\'t work and will probably just return it at that point.If you\\'re looking at buying one of these Ring Doorbells, skip the entry level for the Video Doorbell 2, the Video Doorbell Pro, or the Video Doorbell Elite. It\\'s clear from their support team that the standard version isn\\'t worth their time to support or test anymore. Or just go with a competitor...',\n",
       " 'I like the RIng doorbell.Pros:  Easy enough to set up if you know the right end of a screwdriver and know how to use a drill to mount it on an exterior wall.It works with my exsisting doorbell wireing and chime. Setup video is easy to watch and learn from.When someone rings my doorbell, I get an alert within 1-5 seconds which I feel is good.Video quality is good.Sound is ok to good. Sometimes the sound is a bit choppy at first but levels out so the conversation is understandable.Cons: The biggest negative I have is with the motion detection.  I was picking up people walking on the sidewalk (about 30 from my front door) and cars and trucks passing by my house (about 40 feet from my door). I live on a 2 way street that gets quite a bit of traffic. So I had to turn down the sensitivity to only the first 5 feet from my door as well as putting the app on the \"light\" setting. Now with the motion detection set to the lightest settings, I still get \"false\" alerts when a large vehicle passes by such as a school bus or UPS truck. PLEASE work on this.Another negative (which goes with the above) is since I have RING set to the \"lightest\" setings , when someone walks up to my door, it takes a few seconds to start recording so the peoson is already at my door. I should be able to set the motion sensor to alert me & start recording when someone it about 10 feet from my door AND NOT pick up passing vehicles 30-40 feet away. Please work on this.Also, this device needs to allow the user to just be able to turn on the video camera just to watch outside whenever we want.Fix these few things and you will have a GREAT product. Thank you.',\n",

If you have a slanted wall make sure to add one of the corner blocks or angle blocks to get a better view of the front yard. The video range is pretty good on the basic Ring Doorbell. Video quality is good. We will be adding more Ring products in the near future.  We just pre-ordered the new Ring light and plan on purchasing one of their video cameras soon.Unless you need permanent recordings no need to purchase the monthly subscription. We may add the monthly plan for times we are away at the moment we are on the 30-day free trial. Which is nice to be able to try it out before committing.',\n",
       " \"Not to sure about this product anymore. I was holding out hope for this device, because I saw so many super cool Ring.com Youtube videos and I was waiting for mine to make this amazing breakthrough and just start working to expectation.  Nope!!.. It's been almost two weeks since I mounted the Ring, and I think it's time to call it a fail.  First off, the positives up front, the installation was straight to the point and super easy if you don't try to over think it, like I did. Second, the customer service is very quick and helpful as it relates to troubleshooting. Lastly, because of my ring doorbell, I now know how many school buses pass by my house on a daily basis, can't actually see an entire bus, but just like the UPS truck, the Mail truck, and the garbage/recycling truck, I'm lucky I get notified in enough time to maybe catch a rear bumper or a big unrecognizable blob of mass as they drive out of view. Oh I now have endless videos of the back of my UPS delivery guy and the mail carrier since the ring is so slow to register motion when someone actually walks up to my door.  Yesterday, it  didn't even bother to notify me when a package got dropped off, I received a delivery notice and turned on the live video, and there was the package just sitting there, don't know when it got there or by whom because ring didn't notify me.  The live feed is only goes about 20ft before it's just a bright light with no recognizable feature in the background.  I think that may be because my front door is on a covered cutout, and darker than the area it facing.  At least that's what I've been telling myself all week.  Can't even make out my neighbors house across the street, and their car doesn't even show up in video.\",\n",
       " \"This sounded like a good idea at the time, but now I'm sorry I bought it.  Nothing but problems with it.  First, it was not ringing on my cell phone when someone rang the doorbell.  I spent several hours chatting online with a tech, and then on the telephone.  Finally we figured out how to get it to ring on my cell phone.  But the only notification I receive from the motion sensor is a light vibration, which I don't hear unless I'm on top of my cell phone.  Then there's a problem with the motion sensor itself.  I have fiddled with the settings countless times.  It will register motion if a car passes by my house (I only have the sensor set for 10 feet, and the street is more than 40 feet from the camera), but not if a delivery person drops a box in front of my front door.  It will also register motion and when I look at the video, there has been no motion.  I tried troubleshooting online but it shows me videos that bear no resemblance to what I see on my app.  I just hung up from a phone call with a support tech who sounded like I just woke him up.  He couldn't tell me what to do.  He said the troubleshooting videos on my app are for another upgraded version of Ring.  He suggested that I tilt the unit down.  Huh????  The unit is flush against a brick wall.  Then he said, no, tilt the unit, not the bracket.  How do you tilt the unit when it's fastened to the bracket which is flush to the wall?  Unbelievable.

       " 'With almost 13,000 reviews we’re not sure what we can add to describe how great the Ring Video Doorbell is!  However, this is such a great product; we felt the need to share our opinion and experiences so hopefully this review will help others.We installed the standard Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell at our front door.  Installation was simplicity at its finest…simply replaced the existing wired door bell using the mounting items supplied.  The only thing we had to supply was a drill.  Using the “wired option” enables one of the most useful features….Live View.  Live View lets us look at activity on the front porch at anytime from anywhere.  The doorbell has lived up to all of our expectations.There is a treasure trove of information (including videos) on the Ring web site that can answer just about any question you might have about the product, the installation, and operation.  The only downside that others have mentioned is the $30/year fee for the Cloud Recording function that stores up to 6 months of video on the Ring servers.  In our opinion, this is a small price to pay for the additional convince and security of off-site storage of a video that could become very important if you have an incident that the doorbell captures.With all of the documentation available on the Ring web site, and the details provided here on Amazon, we decided to present an extremely abbreviated list of Pros and Cons.PROS•  Simple installation.  Package included everything (except labor and a drill) needed for a first class installation.•  Quick setup.  Had the unit up and operating in less than 10 minutes from the time we downloaded the app until we were looking at the first picture over WiFi.•  Doorbell can also be operated on battery.  Great for those who do not have a location with power for the doorbell.  All you lose on battery is the Live View function, and who knows, maybe a new version of the app will enable this function :-)CONS•  Fee required for Cloud Recording.  Not a show stopper for us but something to consider for those on a budget.  While the fee isn’t excessive, recurring costs can mount over time.This is a quality product that appears to be very durable.  Recommend you consider this product if you want the additional safety, security and convenience of remotely answering your door.  This product was not provided as a sample for this review.

       " \"Having outfitted our home with many lighting and indoor camera automations, I wanted to add an outdoor camera near the front door. Also, when in the workshop, I often miss visitors coming to the front door. The Ring Video Doorbell is a great solution. Combined with ringer that's more audible throughout the house and the smartphone notification, I can now hear, see, and communicate with visitors from anywhere. The configurable motion detection feature allows us to sense when anyone approaches just within the porch area to avoid notices from passing vehicles. The cloud recording of motion and doorbell events provides a measure of security previously missing.

       " \"After reading some of the less-than-positive reviews here, I was hesitant to get this, but a trusted neighbor had one for a while and said it works well for them. And now I can say I love our Ring doorbell, too; but it took a while to get it setup and working with our devices. Although the review here says I ordered the white color, I actually ordered the bronze, which matches our house colors perfectly. The camera is very clear (much sharper image than the Honeywell wireless cameras we got with our security system) and having the ability to talk to someone from anywhere is priceless to us (we recently had our landscaper show up unexpectedly and being able to answer his ring and talk to him gave us peace of mind that he wasn't going to anything that we hadn't agreed to). The doorbell itself was relatively easy to install and connect to our Wi-Fi network, although at first it didn't work with our Android (Samsung) phones (we didn't get the notifications when someone came to the door).  It also would not trigger our existing doorbell, which is an old-style mechanical type (strikes a bell when triggered, instead of playing a chime or tone), even though I wired it as shown in the installation instructions.  My husband wanted to send it back, but I convinced him that first we needed to give the support folks at Ring a try.  I'm really glad we did, as Ring customer service was very helpful in assisting with trouble-shooting the problems we encountered. It turned out there was a known issue with some Samsung devices not receiving notifications, but during the time they worked with us, it was resolved for the Samsung 6S.  The second issue with the wired Ring not making our mechanical doorbell sound turned out to be a problem with the Ring device we received, so they shipped us a new unit (and covered the shipping costs for us to return the old one).  The new unit install went quickly and now both our upstairs and downstairs mechanical doorbells both sound.  During this process we learned that the Live View option was available with our device (since it's hardwired to our old doorbell), which allows you to use the camera at any time to check your door area, and the customer service rep requested it be turned on for us.  Within a day, we were using Live View.  My husband loves this feature and keeps showing it to everyone he knows. The only remaining issue we have is now is receiving push notifications on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4, which is another known Android problem that is being worked on.  The reason I'm giving 5 stars despite this remaining problem is the speed at which the other issues we encountered were resolved, as it gives me confidence that this one will soon be resolved as well.  In the meantime, it's working perfectly with the other Samsung S6 phone and our iPad.This past weekend, I purchased and installed a Ring doorbell for my best friend for her birthday, who receives a lot of packages for her job and can't always make it to the door in time.  Unfortunately, she didn't have an existing wired doorbell to replace, so it's currently being powered by the internal battery.  Given this, she can't get the Live View feature (apparently this would deplete the battery).  We've been monitoring the battery, but so far (it's only been installed a few days) the power level is still at 100%.  She is going to have her electrician install a low-voltage transformer and resistor to connect the Ring doorbell to, and then she can get Live View added.  Both she and her husband have Samsung phones and iPad's, and the notifications are working well on all of their devices. Please note, I am not affiliated in any way with the Ring company, nor am I being compensated in any way for this review.  Being a gadget geek, I just want to share my experiences with others who may be interested in this device.\",\n",
       " 'Eversince I always have a problem with this doorbell. The notifications that it will send on my phone is delayed all the time or sometimes my phone will send me notifications that someone’s at the door only to realized it happened the PREVIOUS DAY. There were times I cannot even do a live view. We have a panoramic wifi, I even bought a wifi extender. Contacted Ring Tech Support followed all directions still the same problem. Did I just get a defective product?? I am so disappointed good tging I didn’t bought the flood cam',\n",
       " 'I bought this over a year ago. It is located on the side of my house facing my next door neighbor\\'s driveway which is about 15 feet away from the doorbell. There is a road that runs in front of my house which is approximately 50 feet away from the doorbell and perpendicular to it. For the last year every time a large truck goes by it sets off the motion sensor which activates a wind chime notification. This happens all night long and all day long.  I used their app to set the motion zones to the minimum setting without turning off motion sensing. My next door neighbor is able to get in and out of their cars and move up and down their driveway at will without setting off the sensor (15 feet away) but a truck going by on the road 50 feet away and perpendicular to the doorbell sets it off. In fact someone broke into my neighbor\\'s truck and it never set off the motion sensor. I tried turning off the sound whenever I didn\\'t want to be bothered by the motion sensor constantly going off but then I miss people ringing my other Ring  doorbell at the back of the house because the sound is off. I have spent the last 2 days talking to several Ring advisers to remedy this once and for all and I have gotten different information and advise from 5 different people. I have talked to supervisors also with no solution. Today I had one adviser tell me something that her supervisor completely contradicted but then he told me that I must have misunderstood what she said even though he agreed that she said it. Now another supervisor is telling me I should just turn the sound off at night. This is beyond frustrating.Update 3/13/17: I talked to a customer service rep who told me that he would be my own personal rep with Ring until we get this problem solved. They suggested not only a wedge kit that another rep suggested but also a corner kit too. They felt that this would tilt the doorbell down a little bit and away from the road. I received the wedge kit over the weekend and installed it this morning.  This afternoon I received the corner kit.  Now the fun starts. If you put the wedge kit on top of the corner kit or the corner kit on top of the wedge kit (Obviously I tried it both ways) the two mounting holes on the wedge kit DO NOT line up  with the mounting holes with the corner kit.  You can get a screw through the top holes but not the bottom holes. Now I am handy so I got out my drill and was able to lengthen the bottom hole by about 3/8\" to get a screw through both the wedge kit and the corner kit.  This way I was able to mount the wedge and corner kits together. I reinstalled the Ring mount to the wedge/corner kit with the screws provided and reinstalled my doorbell.  The jury is still out on whether it solves my over-notification problem but it actually gives me a much better view of the side door entrance and steps.  So I called my personal rep with this feedback.  I asked him if he had ever installed a Ring doorbell and the wedge/corner kits.  He had not.  I told him about my problem with the screws not lining up and what I had to do to fix the problem. Since he never installed these things he asked me to hold on while he checked with someone.  He then proceeded to tell me that the other person said that I should be able to get enough screws in to mount the doorbell.  Once again I was wrong and whatever I was seeing was wrong. Go figure. Now to make things even worse the guy read off what the other person wrote to him. I guess not only do I not see what is obvious but I didn\\'t understand that I must be wrong and needed to hear it in someone else\\'s words.  Why do I need a personal rep to tell me I must be wrong when I can just call the regular customer service number to have some stranger tell me that what I am seeing is wrong. I love the product for the most part and have recommended it to dozens of people but their customer service reps need work.  Perhaps they should use the products before they try to help other people.',\n",
       " \"I love my Ring Video Doorbell.  I can't speak for how easy is was to install, because I had my handyman do it, but the software part of it was a breeze.  Already, I've expected packages when I was not at home, but  I was able to talk to the FedEx guy from a distance and arrange when he could deliver my package at a time that I'd be home.  If I didn't have my Ring videobell, my package would have gone back to the FedEx center, and I'd have to jump through hoops to pick it up.  Same with my UPS guy - I spoke to him while I was out to dinner with my sister and asked him to leave the package at the back door.  I like that I can see who is standing on my doorstep without having to open the door or look out the window. Prior to getting my Ring videobell, I have had issues with packages being stolen from off my top step, so the Ring videobell recording whoever approaches my door is a great benefit.  The video recording is part of a service that they charge for.  The first thirty days are free, and then it's $30 a year after that.  Well worth it, in my opinion.Okay, so the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that sometimes there's a lag between the movement in front of the house and the recording.  Not a large lag, but large enough to notice.  Also, the instructions are not really clear about charging the battery.  You need to take the bell off the brace (easy to do) every few months and charge the unit.  Not a problem, but the instructions should be clearer on that.Otherwise I really love my video doorbell.\",\n",
       " 'The GOOD: - Video doorbell with battery power allows its use on those areas without wired doorbells. - Good communications and quick response on the phone when doorbell is rung - The software warns you when the battery needs to be recharged.The BAD: - Severe lag in detecting motion and recording it. More often than not, a fast moving individual was through the door or out on the sidewalk before the device started recording, leaving a video of a blank entrance (see video). - The motion detection appears to be focused straight ahead. On a house with stairs/stoop, it does not detect motion until the visitor is right through the door.  Any attempt to extend the range only results in tall vehicles (SUVs, trucks, etc) being recorded. - While the battery option is great and provides for freedom of location, the claim of one year between charges is wildly exaggerated if you use the motion detection feature. Between all the trials to try to get the right motion detection and avoid all the passing cars, the bell asked for recharge a month into its first use. - Because the charging port is hidden in the back, recharging the battery requires physically unscrewing and removing the device from its location. - Battery charging takes a minimum of five hours.I think that the motion detection issues have been solved with the new Ring Pro (I dislike the term \"pro\". It implies that it is for professional use, when it\\'s just a better model). Unfortunately, that doesn\\'t do anything for someone who bought the original or who has problems wiring the location.I suppose that the new  Ring Stickup cam with a solar panel could solve the motion detection issue and allow the Ring doorbell to have a much longer battery life but that adds a hefty price tag to your front door. The fact that the pickup cam would require a separate storage plan from Ring does not help matters.I\\'m waiting to see the reviews for the Zmodo Torch Pro - Smart Door Light and Connected Doorbell.',\n",
       " 'I just love the Ring Products. I have a Ring Pro with the Ring Chime Pro for the front of my house wired directly to a Elk Transformer 24v with the power kit v2 and works awesome so I got the Ring Video for the rear of the house looking over the patio, pool and canal. I have it wired directly to a Elk Transformer with a resistor so I dont have to worry about charging the battery and a Chime Pro there also. The motion detection on both are awesome. Just love the control of the motion detection settings far better than any other device I ever had. The Neighbors app is awesome to notify other Ring users and the Ring app users of any activity in your area plus Sheriff Office is tied into the app and post any criminal activity. The set up of all their devices are easy and there chat is awesome to help you with any problems. Awesome company with a A+ grade in my book and only gets better.

       " \"So Ive had this installed for almost a week now and it just sucks.  The Ring Bell is literally 10 ft from my WIFI and it has very poor picture.  Its always pixelated and when I try to talk to some one it is distorted both ways.  It is very easy to hook up and install.  But I tried to do the hook up to my wired door bell and it worked at first and now it doesn't.  So I had to buy the ring doorbell. $$$.  And now I have absolutely no picture when I try to view my camera LIVE VIEW. Cant figure out why.  I've reset it and still nothing.  I get a picture when it is pushed but that is the only time and it is still distorted.  The motion detector to phone alert time is horrible. By the time my phone is alerted I see nothing or might catch the end of what set it off.  Once again, my router is 10 ft. away from the damn thing.  I am totally dissatisfied with his product.  Maybe I got a defective one or something but for all the good things Ive heard I am disappointed!\",\n",
       " 'This is a follow up to my original review. I received an email from Ring support after my 1 star review.  I have to say the customers support from Ring was exceptional.  I told her my issues and she sent me a new device.  This has addressed almost all of my issues. The only thing I would still highlight as not quite perfect is the response time for the doorbell. My new device is faster, but still need an earlier notification to catch the person as they come to your door.  I would recommend this device and the company after my customer service experience.This camera is easy to install and takes good video.  The 1st generation (720P) is really all you need.  There are some negatives that have been mentioned by others that you have to know. 1) video is lagged.  No matter what you have set up (hard wired power and close proximity to your router), the timing of you receiving your video almost assures that you will miss anyone at your door unless they ring multiple times. 2) the motion sensitivity varies - no consistency even after it is set correctly. 3) most importantly, the company does not even allow for a short (7 day) review of videos unless you buy their service subscription.  I was very surprised by this and would have expected at for $100 for the device they could store your videos for a certain time or a certain amount of storage.  So for example, the lagged video means that if you try to watch your video from your front door and pick it up immediately you will miss the person that was there unless you can review the video which you cannot do unless you pay a monthly fee.',\n",
       " 'This is one of those products that really make a difference in your home when it comes to convenience. You can always see if someone is at the door, and talk to them.Pros:  1. Really easy to install. Comes with very simple and straight foward instructions and everything you need to install it including a tiny little level to make sure its installed straight.2. You can set it up to pick up motion, and notifies you, so you can see who\\'s there even when they don\\'t \"Ring\" the Ring. Also, you can select the sensitivity of the motion activation.  You\\'re also able set up schedules for when you want it active.3. Wide angle lens lets you see more than you would think you could see. Also has good picture at night.Cons 1. The only thing that I would suggest a change is if you\\'re going to drill the holes in bricks. It is very hard to drill the holes exactly where they should be because of the rock , it makes the drill bit jump or move a little and it is hard to fix the hole after that. The way the screw holes are in the bracket, it leaves almost no room for errors. I had to drill a hole in the plastic right next to the actual hole to get the screw in . I would suggest making the bottom two holes a bit longer , kind of like an oval, in case the holes were not drilled perfect.Overall, this is product is awesome and a great value. Gives you great peace of mind and security knowing who is going and coming to your house.',\n",
       " 'We have a 30ft sidewalk coming up to our front porch step, it would only capture 5ft from the camera because the motion will be there, camera will click on, start up and them start recording. So people walking passed or cars driving or people coming up to your house may not be recorded.The video is also garbage, grainy and can never clearly show faces. The wifi signal was strong and was hardwired.Ultimately we had to replace this doorbell, and purchased the updated one because the video got too grainy. I removed it from the base plate and noticed the connections started to corrode. Once I disconnected the camera from the hardwire, it would not turn on and would not charge itself. The ring was totally bricked.Would not recommend this model, spend the extra dollars and upgrade, the quality is so much better and records seconds before it gets triggered so you get to watch the motion before it starts to after it finishes.',\n",
       " \"I'm returning this item because, shortly after installation, it started interferring with the bluetooth on my phone and started broadcasting my phone calls through the doorbell.  This is definitely a security hazard.  This happened repeatedly, and the very fact that it *can* happen freaks me out.  Be very cautious about using this device.  If this can happen, I am concerned about how else the phone call data can be accessed via this device.\",\n",
       " \"I love the idea of this device. I get a TON of packages from various places weekly so I wanted it more to let others know if something was taken. However there are some issues that are consistent with other reviews. Both my and my daughters devices didn't fit on the post the original doorbell was on. So in both cases we had to drill and move the unit then putty and paint. This device is significantly wider than a regular door bell. Second the time it takes to setup is realistically 30 minutes with no issues. However with both my daughter and I there were issues, different ones but issues. She has a complicated password with characters on her WiFi which Ring doesn't work with. After three calls to Ring she had to change her WiFi password. There were also connectivity issues for her that delayed the setup. Hers took almost 2 hours and 3 calls to Ring bit did work. Mine was easier but still took half an hour. The other issues is the delay from someone triggering the device till the video pops up on your phone. Normally by the time it pops up the person is gone. Not a horrible issues but if you wanted to see who was at the door before answering it would be a problem. That's not why I got the unit so for me not a concern. Overall its ok but were I in the market for something like this I would buy a different brand.\",\n",
       " 'I waited...I waited to give them a chance to work through any kinks, and then (fortunately it turns out), I decided to try out the lower end model before shelling out a couple of hundred for a product with mixed reviews.  And then, when Amazon bought them, I thought - yay!  I trust it now, and it is on my list.  Months later, I finally buy it and anxiously await the arrival of my new gadget that will allow me to save packages from the rain and feel a bit more secure overall.  (It wasn\\'t that high on my list, admittedly.)So, it arrives.  Well-packaged, on time.  Simple install and set-up instructions, which is good since I had to do it 3 times due to conflicting wi-fi signals (phone app - not their fault).  Then, with my son\\'s help, we mount the device neatly on the door and proceed to push the button - and I get these lovely notifications on my phone.  That when followed show me a black screen with the words \"Your phone is having trouble connecting to Ring.\"So...I restart my phone.  I google it.  I remove the device, re-add the device, re-set-up the device (2x this time)...no love. So, I check my router and wi-fi speed test and then I buy the Chime Pro wi-fi extender, wait anxiously for it to arrive, and go through all of the steps again (since first time obviously didn\\'t take, but that\\'s understandable)..and....\"Your phone is having trouble connecting to Ring.\"  Every...effin\\'...time....\"Your phone is having trouble connecting to Ring.\"...every effin\\' TIME.......  I meditate a bit, trying to regrow that lost hair...have a couple of drinks, try it again, and \"Your phone is having trouble connecting to Ring.\"....sigh....it\\'s time to write my own review.I feel like my name is now Dave and Front Door is HAL.  I don\\'t know if I should take it out back and shoot it or just leave it up as a constant reminder to be kind to our AI brothers and sisters....and maybe, just maybe, one day it will show me a picture...maybe...and it\\'s not like it can actually do anything anyway other than sporadically notice my comings and goings and possibly send blank pictures to the cloud....of my sporadically coming and going - and maybe the lizards on the wall...but, I digress...I still haven\\'t taken it down - don\\'t want those ugly holes in the wall showing my shame to my neighbors with their \"traditional\" doorbells...oh...the humanity....But, seriously, save your money - or at least don\\'t waste it on the Ring (one, I presume) version of this product.  Maybe after Amazon has a chance to really dig into it, we\\'ll get a new release that fits the same wall plate (or at least same ugly holes in my front wall) and actually works.  Like Echo.

       " \"What a great idea - see who's at the door and chat with them before getting out of bed or from the office or while on vacation.  Those things would be awesome, but the fastest internet we can get at our house only offers a .5Mbit uplink.  By specification (and verified with Ring support), the doorbell requires a minimum of 1Mbit uplink speeds on your internet connection to function optimally.  Over our .5Mbit, we notice a good picture/video, but the audio is very delayed and breaks up, making 2-way communication impractical.Many of our other IoT devices (webcams, garage door, thermostat, Tablo DVR, etc.) are able to function without an internet connection at all (i.e., while connected to the in-house WiFi) and will continue to work or work well within or without.  The Ring doorbell architecture requires an internet connection even if you are using the doorbell while connected to WiFi inside your house.Other negatives are that by the time we receive notifications that the doorbell has been pressed and can connect to the doorbell to see what's going on, the person has already left.  Usually this is just package delivery, but it has happened with regular visitors.  There is a subscription fee for recordings with no way to record the video using an app or computer program.  $30/yr seems a little steep.  I would think that $30 should cover it, forever.Other than that, the battery does seem to last a long time - at least 3 months.  The documentation says that really cold weather can zap the battery.  We found this to be true with many bouts of subzero temps earlier this winter.  However, we installed it in September and didn't need to recharge until about Christmas.  Haven't needed to do another recharge.  We did NOT have the instant monitoring feature enabled (wherein you can open the app anytime to view the camera).  This is said to run down the battery significantly faster when enabled.For $100, this camera is a good value, if not great, if you have more than 1Mbit uplink on your internet connection.  The recording feature, otherwise known as 'the gift that keeps on costing,' as my dad would say, is a bit steep.  A one-time fee would be much better there.Still, I would like to see a doorbell like this with camera and 2-way audio that is capable of full WiFi operation even without internet/fast internet (from within the house, anyway).  Any ideas, please respond!\",\n",
       " \"I'd actually give this 2.75 stars because there are some major annoyances, however it is useful... when it works. First off, it is slow to establish a connection and slow to detect motion and alert you. I've had people deliver packages and it didn't notify me even though they're like 18 inches from the doorbell. On the other hand, it alerts when the trash trucks drive buy 50 feet away from the house. Or it alerts and I can never figure out why.Sometimes it alerts me and when I try to see the video clip it isn't available on the server. The other day I had to wait over an hour for it to show up. I'm nervous to buy the new version until I feel confident they've addressed these issues. (BTW: My wifi is really good, so it isn't to blame).So the good stuff is that I have from time to time had conversations with the person at my door and their surprise was awesome. I also caught someone trying to steal a package -- a 40lb bag of kitty litter believe it or not.I feel like if I could mash the person detection of my Nest cam with the doorbell functionality of this thing, it'd be just about perfect.\",\n",

The ring video doorbell 2 came with a year recording. And I can\\'t extend that to Ring security system. Because \"that\\'s not how the payment system is designed.\" Fair enough.My next call, the ring device is not alerting on time. Can you unscrew the device and bring it closer to the router?

Neither one of us gets the recommendation credit, because \"we did not go through the proper channel.\" Oh, so now it\\'s our fault that we are stupid that we did not go through their convoluted process.

I enquired, \"oh this is your phone\\'s fault. The app works exactly what it is supposed to be.\" I told the rep that other apps like android messages, facebook messenger, do not work like that. If the phone is not on silent, they don\\'t wake me up with vibration. The rep insisted that I do not understand how my phone works. After spending about an hour, I gave up.It\\'s astonishing, how Amazon the most consumer-centric organization has this brand which has, so far, the worst product support.At this time, I am willing to just smash all the ring products and say bye-bye to my $500.

       " \"I have two of these doorbell devices.  One I have owned for almost two years, the other is this one I bought on Amazon.  For the first year the device responded well, recorded video and generally worked pretty good.  For the past 6 months, things have changed 180 degrees to the negative.  The Android application takes forever to respond and locks the phone up until it does respond, meaning you can not use your phone for a very long period every time the application is accessed, either on purpose or because it has to reload every time you change screens.  Also, and I assume this is because they have over-sold their system, it is impossible at times to load any of the recorded video.  I have set and watched the screen on the phone for as much as 10 minutes waiting for a video to display (using WIFI), only to have it freeze for additional extended periods while it tries to play the video.  And today, it sensed a person walking past it but did not record anything, nothing.  Motion sensing entry is there but no video at all.  It isn't the battery, it shows (when you can get the application to load) to be over half full.  Suffice it to say, the principle is good, the implementation is really really poor and getting worse the more of these they sell.  Tried their support, not a comment or suggestion.  Be aware.\",\n",

Between 2 CSRs and 40 minutes, they managed to fix my issue.  ... for about 5 minutes, then the thing started up again.When I asked the Ring Neighborhood community if they were experiencing similar issues, Ring took down my post (citing the content wasnt security related... but they leave up their own ads).Also, regardless of how you set your detection range, the camera always picks up motion at the horizon line.  My only option to not get a notification every time a car drives by my house (on the road, 30+ ft away), is to angle the camera down towards the ground, which eliminates faces in my camera feed, rendering the camera useless.2 stars because of 5 star customer service.  2 stars because of a 0 star product.  I believe Ring is focused on marketing more than actual security.  Why else would I get directed to a social media feed peppered with Ring self-promotion?',\n",
       " \"It was working great until recently.I have spent far too much time talking to customer service about this doorbell.  It really worked great until last month.  Since then I have had multiple emails with customer service, an hour long phone call, and other shorter calls.The doorbell keeps forgetting our network even though I have been assured the latest firmware release was supposed to fix that.  We have to continuously bring it in the house and manually configure the doorbell.  The power went out on Sunday, our Chime Pro was able to re-establish a connection but the Ring Doorbell would not even though it is the device that has a battery, so it certainly should be able to keep the wireless information stored in memory.  Today there was no power or wifi outage, but the doorbell lost connection at some point and would not connect again.  This is the only device we have to set back up in our house every time it loses the wifi signal.  Our blu-ray players, video consoles, phones, security cameras, televisions, computers, etc., etc. can all remember the network and connect back up.It now makes a clicking noise that is new, but I can't figure out what triggers it.  It seems to be motion, but that clicking noise was not audible until today.  The digital ring (made by the doorbell itself) occasionally sounds garbled.  The doorbell always says it is hardwired in, even when I am holding it in my hand, which isn't a big deal except that means I am able to access live view and drain the battery quickly when I should not be able to and customer service confirmed this behavior happened during one of my phone calls.I cannot get customer service to acknowledge that mine might actually possibly be defective as I know two other people that own this doorbell, have the same version of firmware and do not have the problems that I have.  Customer service keeps blaming it on weak signal, but that doesn't explain why these problems didn't exist before.  If anything the signal should be stronger given we now have a Chime Pro.\",\n",

I am using the hardwired option and the inside doorbell would half work.... so I had to tie wrap the doorbell to the bracket. which looks hideous. but it works.....',\n",
       " \"This product gets 5 stars from me for peace of mind.  Does it have flaws? Yes,  but nothing I can't deal with.  Some of them include- touchy motion detection,  low level quality for night vision and sound quality is hit or miss. I've changed my motion settings multiple times so it is pretty much on my front porch and still, cars are setting it off. My house is set far enough back from our quiet street that this should not happen.  It is better now,  but does continue to occur daily.  As for night vision,  I must have my porch light on or the image quality is very poor and limited to about a foot from the doorbell. As for sound quality, it is not easy to have even a brief conversation, like they show in the commercials. The person at the door is easy to hear but they have difficulty hearing you, at least,  that's what we found in our tests.  Despite all of this,  the peace of mind it comes with is well worth the minor inconveniences.  I wish that I would have purchased this sooner.  We're already looking to get another for our backyard.\",\n",

I made sure to add a sticker letting my neighbors knows they are being recorded to freak them out and deter them from possible criminal activity, at least anywhere near my front door! They might think I’m wired but they should be stupid enough to try anything at least while my camera is still on the wall. I do wish the camera was more concrete. Permanent. Not so easy to remove.... shame on you ‘ring’ for making this camera easy to remove. I have to remove it and charge it? It’s easy for me, why shouldn’t it be easy for a criminal. If I were going to rob someone or any kind of criminal behavior at someone’s residence, I would remove this camera first. It’s easy to do. I wish you would make it permanent.

       " \"I mostly bought this for answering the doorbell, since I often can't quickly get to my door. Somewhat annoyingly, it's usually ~15 seconds from the time my phone notifies me someone is at the door until it connects to the video on the doorbell. It's not the end of the world, but just  a little annoying.The motion sensor is really bad though. My house is set back about 20 feet from the street. I've set the range of the motion detector to minimum, and the settings show it only looking for motion about 5 feet from my door, but I still frequently get notifications when cars drive by my house. As a result, I almost always just ignore the motion detector. My friends got the better version of the ring doorbell, and they said the motion detector was a lot better.Also, it says the video quality is high definition. It's definitely not. The videos are very pixelated. But the better version of the ring seems to have higher quality.\",\n",

They sent me a filter that removed that sound. But the doorbell would not ring after that.  With the Ring, no filter needed and the doorbell rings.2.  The field of view is superior on this device.3.  The alerts are much faster than with the Zmodo.  It would sometimes take 10-15 seconds if at all on the Zmodo.  With the Ring, so far the alerts are received in the app in about 2 seconds.4.  The Ring lets you customize the motion areas and sensitivity.Installation.Physical installation was a breeze.  I was changing an existing doorbell camera though.Setup was about as easy as I could imagine.  Just download the app, add a device and it pretty much took over and did it.  I didn't even have to think about it.I also added a remote chime although I really don't need it since my doorbell chime rings now.Overall, I am very happy I made the switch.Update:  I get motion alerts at times from cars going by even though I have the zone tuned down to the minimum.  Also, at times I connect to live view and just get a black screen.Twice it has lost connection (I think) and I had to push the doorbell button to get it back online.Still happy with it, but can't keep the rating at a 5.Another update:  too many times when I go into the live view I get a black screen.  Dropping to 3 stars\",\n",

I had to install mine on a stone house and to my surprise it had a drill bit for drilling into brick or wood. It was easy to install.It was easy to install on my iPhone, just download the Ring App, register it and the rest is very easy . I don't have a doorbell so I am using the installed battery. I did a full charge on it and it has been two weeks now and I and still at 80%, it depends on how you set it up will determine how much battery usage you will spend.I like the option of the various ring tones and how much you want to see. Since I live close to a road, I had to reset the motion sensor (you do this with the app) to that I won't get traffic driving by the house.I know when anyone is near or on our porch now. Get heads up with a package is delivered including the mail. I really like this product. I want to get another one for our back door. At anytime you can use your app to go live and see what is happening in your front yard. It gives me a peace of mind when I leave the house, anyone that comes near or on our front porch it is being recorded. Our grandson was on the front porch and I was talking to him through the Ring doorbell. He was pleasantly surprised that I could see and talk to him. We all got a good laugh out of it.

Either the image sensor was being damaged or lens was melting in the sun!One day I tracked the path of the sun near my front door and found out that the sun is shining directly on the ring for about 5 hours a day! I’m suspecting this is the root cause because for about a month when it was new I got HD quality and overtime pictures just got fuzzier!',\n",

What's bad is a) it's hard to delete an event without causing it to come up loud (when you tap on the three-dot menu, most of the time, you get the event replay instead of the pop-up menu), so you can't risk cleaning up events unless you're alone where noise doesn't matter, b) local police reports can't be scheduled and the notification can't be muted, so whenever it arrives (you're in a movie theatre, business meeting, church, etc.) you and everyone around you must endure the notification, c) the neighborhood thing is questionable: many people put in completely irrelevant comments or questions (does anyone recognize this person who came to my door?), complaints, notifications (I lost my dog; has anyone seen it?); filtering these is nearly impossible. Basically, the app is written by developers who don't use it in the same environment as customers and there's no way to insulate yourself from thoughtless neighbors.If I had it to do again, I think I'd wait or look for a more professional, security package than Ring.\",\n",

       " 'This review is for the Ring Video Doorbell, not the Ring2. The basic setup is easy. In minutes the doorbell is up and running. Depending on how you mount it the time involved will vary. Mine replaced an existing doorbell bell button and is connected to the wiring. I did not know what to expect, but much of what is on Ring’s website makes you think the low end product is really amazing. When all is said and done the basic Ring doorbell is better than nothing and would certainly be a deterrent in most instances. Just having the ability to see when a package it delivered or talk to someone at the door is a big benefit. But if you want more get the Ring2. I gave this a “4” because for the price it really does a decent job. One thing that would be really nice is the ability to answer the door from any Amazon Echo. You can get doorbell chimes, but two way talking can only be done with Echo Spot.I experienced two of the same issues as other reviewers, short battery life and recordings not starting until the person is on my porch or already walking away. As I researched these issues I found that there is a lot that is not very clear when first installing. It took quite a bit of tweaking to get things working to make the Ring useful.ChargingMy comments only apply if you are using existing wiring. One thing the mounting instructions are clear about, the back panel must be completely flat. There can be no bend in it so that the contacts on the back all make clean contact to the mounting plate. The wires should be clean and free of corrosion. The existing wires do not power the Ring. They only charge the battery. The Ring still runs on the battery. Our transformer is the standard 16 volts. It essentially trickle charges. The more video the camera records, the more battery life gets used up. Contrary to the 6 months to 1 year of “normal” usage on a single charge, the battery can get used up very fast. 8-10 recordings over a 24 hr. hour period can use 10% of the battery. It can take several days for the battery to charge from 85% to 100%, though I have yet to see it higher than 98%. In order to have a balance that allowed the charging to have a fighting chance to keep up I had to select “Light” under motion frequency.Recording startup and motion sensingI was annoyed that most times when someone approached the front door the recording would not start until they got there or only as they were walking away. This evidently has to do with the fact that the WiFi signal strength is not enough to connect to the cloud faster to begin the recording. Ring has a web page that talks about RSSI and recording time. RSSI rating is found in Device Health. Mine was around -52 to -57. While the help page says this is better than most, it turned out that it was not enough. After reading Ring’s page about RSSI, I bought a small WiFi extender and put it just on the other side of the wall where the Ring is. This brought my RSSI up to -37 to -39. The Ring is now recording movement an additional 10-15 feet earlier than before. I also had to adjust the overall motion detector distance several times to avoid picking up moving cars on the street (about 25 feet from my door) but still get someone walking up the driveway (about 15 feet). I still get some cars but so far the Ring is working fairly well.',\n",
       " \"We  had been thinking about getting one of these for a while, after the package bomber scare here in Austin.  Then we saw that they are now working with our Echo and that made us act.  Unfortunately, you cannot talk via Alexa, only see the video, but that's still better than what we had before.  Since it works via wifi, there are some inherent limitations, but if you have connection issues, you can usually solve those with an extender.  Also, our phones save the videos when we look at who is at the front door, so it really isn't necessary to spend the extra money on backing them up to the cloud.  We initially signed up to have somebody install it, but it turned out to be very simple to do.  All tools come with it, even a very clever little snap-on level.  We replaced a wired door bell.  Since it was mechanical, nothing special needed to be done and our doorbell still sounds the same.  Digital doorbells need an extra step to connect but, again, everything you need is included.  The installation video is very helpful, too.  We are definitely satisfied with our purchase!\",\n",
       " 'Connected easy right out of the box. however after 2- 2 1/2 weeks after the install the WiFi connection to the Ring Door Bell started to freeze and wouldn’t get alerts on my app and the live video had a very poor connection.

I have100 megs/Wi-Fi and new brand new router that is with in 10 feet of my Doorbell. All my other devices through out my home work perfectly fine.

       " 'Absolutely love my RING doorbell. Have it connected to my phone, my wifes phone, iPad, and a spare iphone used for our baby monitor. Its great that if you have an existing doorbell, you can connect the wires giving you the original chime in the house and illuminating the white light around the doorbell on the RING. Great for night time.I know who comes and goes from ringing my doorbell, but I opted not to use the motion sensor since it goes off when my neighbors go in and out of there house.Cant wait til they finally release the on-demand camera for this. There have been times when people knock on my door and I have to look through the peep hole to see who it is.Install is a breeze and connected to my WIFI with no problem. I you have spotty WIFI, I suspect that it would take sometime to ring your phone. The RING notifies my devices in a matter of 1-3 seconds, but mostly 1 sec.UPDATE: Received the RING Chime, and absolutely love it. This is installed in the laundry room where it may be a bit loud. Also there may be times when I forget to bring my phone with me, so this makes up for it.Since I do have 2 doors into my home, I would love to purchase another one. At the current price point of $199, I would stick with the 1 that I have. Paying another $199 for my side door is a bit overkill.UPDATE 2 01/30/2017: Still til this day, I absolutely love my RING doorbell. The LiveView is excellent to have when you want to see who is at the door or if you hear noises. I now use RING as a digital peephole with another spare iPhone that I mounted to my front door. If for any reason my phone is not near me to see who rang my bell, or if my baby sitter is home when the doorbell rings, they can look at the iPhone on the door. One thing about this that I did bring to RING attention is that someone has to swipe on the screen to display video. I have asked for a request to make feature that will enable video automatically on the phone.Aside from that, yesterday I received my RING Solar Security Sign and this is really a nice addition to my home security system. Aside from my RING doorbell, I also have security cameras around my home. The RING Solar Security Sign is nice and bright, but not blinding bright and really catches your eye. Intruders will see this before they think of breaking in.',\n",
       " 'How sad. It promises to be great but really it\\'s only marginal.Here\\'s the real scoop, something you might not read on other reviews.The doorbell part is good. Fine, Works great, whether battery or on doorbell power. Note that you\\'ll have to buy an overpriced resistor to wire this to your 24 volt transformer powered doorbell supply, but I\\'ll take the hit.The bad news is that the first one was returned because it was too sensitive! Even at the lowest setting and at minimal 5 foot distance, the motion detector was going off every ten minutes. I tried a factory reset, had input from Ring technicians about the problem, and they finally conceded it was bad and I shipped it back (thank you Amazon!). Now the new one comes in, works great for a day or two, and then, even at the lowest setting, senses motion about every 10-15 minutes. Constant alarms that are so bad, I turned it off. Now you might think that it\\'s really motion causing them, but NO. A truck goes by on the road (40 feet away) and it sees it. A breeze blows some leaves, 20 feet away, and it sees it. Often, nothing at all seems to trigger the motion detector, and it\\'s such a continuous nuisance that it\\'s better off turned off! Really ring? Just de-tune it a bit; that\\'s all we ask!  It\\'s well known in security electronics and fire protection that this is one of the main reasons people don\\'t use alarm systems: the nuisance alarms. As a pro and an electrician, I well know that motion detection can be tuned and refined; it\\'s done all the time on outside lighting, but somehow on Ring, this idea has been lost. At it\\'s lowest setting, everything within 10 feet will trigger the motion detection, and it will record terabites of useless video. You\\'ll have to manually delete these, one at a time on your device; be prepare to spend one evening a month erasing nuisance recordings!Now, here\\'s the really offensive part. Ring not only won\\'t let you mass-delete them, but after you\\'ve deleted a dozen or so, Ring software engineers have decided to piggyback ads for more Ring stuff on your delete command. So you hit \"delete recording\" and their television style video streams into your face, with two options: \"set up a device\" and \"Login.\" But it does not matter if you log in or not, this does not change a thing, Ring still will not let you delete the recordings, instead opting for an advertisement! Head\\'s up, Ring, this won\\'t sell more of your stuff; it will only cause guys like me to write scathing reviews and people won\\'t buy your product! I can\\'t wait until my free  month is up so it won\\'t save ANY RECORDINGS!  (I won\\'t give them another $30.00 so they can prevent me from deleting recordings and stream continual ads into my iphone) Here\\'s the scoop: doorbell good, don\\'t set up to record, ever! Motion sensor absolutely useless... Ring, if you read this you really need to up your game, or Piper is going to smoke your butt and we can\\'t wait for that to happen!',\n",
       " 'Very dissapointed with this product. The motion sensitivty settings dont really work. We live on a busy street and it will alert you when most cars drive by, but not the ones that enter your driveway.  Tried a different mounting technique with the driveway in the main view of the camera and the samr thing happens. You have to set the sensitivity to very sensitive in order to see what enters your driveway. That means, even if you disable certain zones on the camera, it will still alert you if a garbage truck or dump.truck drives down the road.  Decrease sensitivity juat a little, and you have to walk up to the doorbell before it registers you. This also creates an issue if you are running on battety power because you have to mount it in a weird location, that youll have to charge your doorbell every few weeks otherwise you dont have any notifications. Contacted customer support about the issue, he said we currently dont have a resolution for the issue. Did not offer to replace or upgrade the device to try to solve.  Very unfortunate.',\n",
       " \"The concept is good but it needs more research and work. Thanks to the RING support that is very helpful and knowledgeable that usually corrects the shortcomings of the unit. The main problem is the communication between the outside unit RING bell and your Wi-Fi router or the modem. I would say in general it works but it's very inconsistent in the accuracy and in the total performance. There are more failures than I would accept to register some motion detections and even when you are notified, it only shows the spinning loading ring but no video. I have noticed that if you checked later, you could see the recorded motion video around your unit. Another problem is the delay after something happens near your unit and the time you can see the event (about 1 minute or more).I know that all these are because of weak Wi-Fi signals but I use Xfinity cable Internet giving me more than 90 Mbs and even outside near the RING unit, there is 30 Mbs speed using their speed calculator that is more than enough to get consistent operation. Now they would say about Wi-Fi obstructions and I might need their Wi-Fi booster specially made for RING devices. However, after I read the reviews about this booster, I felt it would not make much differences.Let be realistic who does have his/her modem or router next to the outside door? Mine is on the third level of my house but very close to the wall that is on the same side as the RING bell. My smart TV is on the first level and close to the front door, however, I don't have any problems with weak Wi-Fi and it works fine.Saying all that, I still would keep the unit and hoping it might work better. The price of $100 plus you might need their booster that is another $50 is something too much for retiree. If I knew all that before investing in this security device, I probably wouldn't buy it.\",\n",
       " \"After spending more than $150( including a wi fi extender) , I would expect this door bell to work almost perfectly....but it doesn't. It is spotty as far as performance with video coming thru sometimes and not others. I am still troubleshooting it.What I like..knowing there is someone near my door . The e motion chime notification is a great feature. I seem to have the motion zone set up well, that way it does not chime every time a car passes.  Video quality is good when I do get It!What I don't like..Like most people I bought this bell so I could see who is at my door and speak to them from afar. Well most times the video with the speak icon is so delayed the person would be gone by the time the image came on my phone!! It's not consistent..sometimes it is ok, other times not. I think they needed  to perfect this before they put it on the market. It's not cheap and for the company to keep suggesting add one  more thing to fix a problem is very poor customer service. I would rather pay 200 hundred and have a product that works well & isn't frustrating in the process.For now I am keeping it..but am disappointed with the consistency .Also the instructions make it seem like plug and play,  but it's not. If you choose to get this look at every tutorial on you tube about set up. That was the only way I was able to trouble shoot. Some problems occur because your Android is not set up properly as far as its microphone or  allowing ring devices. So be patient if you choose to get this. Go thru every feature one at a time. Motion zones need to be set in order  to get motion, ring alerts need to set to on. Make sure you have plenty of time on the day you choose to set it up. Also check your wi fi signal as well because I wound up buying a wi fi extender. The ring chime PRO has a wi fi extender built in, so that may have been a better choice!If it doesn't  work well with ring chime, the company recommends ring chime PRO..ok I got it, now I need to buy something else.. are you catching on now??!!It's useful for knowing if there is someone approaching, ( I did buy the mounting angle bracket for $9.99), It gave me the perfect angle to have my camera view a large area.You can also view the video of who was at the door, ( even if it's delayed I still like knowing who was on my property)So yes, I would buy it again , but if there is a more reliable similar bell out there for a bit more, I would go with that.\",\n",
       " '****UPDATE****I called customer service and they walked me though how to get my Ring connecting to my modem/WiFi and bingo, it’s been good since and I love it (so far). Still don’t like how the bracket is weird against my stucco but there’s not much I can do about that.I’ve been eyeballing the Ring doorbell for well over a year now and after researching multiple home surveillance systems, lightbulbs, nanny cams, and faux video doorbells I decided to go with the Ring.1.) I have stucco walls so installation was NOT as easy as the instructions led on to believe. The bracket doesn’t sit flush w/the wall so screwing the bracket to the wall was frustrating.2.) Nowhere did I see where it says the modem needs to be in close proximity in order for WiFi to work w/Ring. My modem is upstairs and my doorbell is obviously downstairs outside, I have yet to actually connect and see live feed. There is ZERO connection. If I cannot move my modem downstairs so it’s closer to the Ring, it’s going to be returned.3.) I am worried about theft.

If  I can't receive the Ring alert notification, how am I able to speak to the person/people who rang the doorbell at that moment?  Getting the motion or Ring alert notifications are the main reason for me to purchase this product. I don't know if this is just my problem or others also have the same experiences.

       " \"The Ring Video Doorbell has given a little peace of mind regarding our security.  It does not always pick up movement, and it sometimes seems to go off without movement, which is what makes it less than perfect.  But it was easy to install, and it works far more often than it doesn't.  I had one of the more difficult installations onto a stucco wall, but since I already had a doorbell, there was power readily available, and it's worked well off the wired power.I like being able to check out the front door any time from anywhere.  I also like the instant notifications if anything is going on, especially if someone comes to the door when I'm not immediately available to answer.  I haven't used the intercom feature very much, but it's a nice touch, and potentially very useful aspect of the product.Overall, I'd recommend it and hope that Ring keeps improving on an already great product.  I also would like to see that upgrades are able to use the same mounting bracket, making moving to the latest iteration even easier.\",\n",
       " \"UPDATED REVIEW:After a very bad experience with customer service refusing to help me, I was able to get in contact with the right person, who cheerfully replaced my doorbell with an updated, functional unit and held my hand until it was installed correctly and working properly. I’m once again delighted with my purchase and with Ring customer service.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I loved my Ring doorbell for seven months. At that point, it stopped charging and ringing the hardwired doorbell. I tried resetting it multiple times, cleaning contacts, clicking my heels three times, etc. No joy. It still connects to my wifi, but it simply won't work anymore with the house doorbell wiring (which is still working perfectly - I of course checked that).Things go wrong and this would be okay if the Ring people would simply provide a warranty replacement, but I've been trying to get them to help me for a few days now and they have so far refused to help. Their representative doesn't even know how the device works (claimed the hardwiring won't charge the unit, even though their support page confirms it does and it in fact kept it charged for seven months).Very, very disappointing customer service experience. I can't recommend this product to anyone.\",\n",
       " \"This device worked fine for about 8 months - good video, motion detection, etc, And then it went off the rails... Suddenly (nothing changed on my end with my network, devices, etc.) it just stopped recording and replaying video. I contacted support and was met with a bunch of useless info. (Uninstall / reinstall the app, reset the device, change the WiFi network, etc.) I DID IT ALL and nothing changed. (My Blink cameras around the house all work flawlessly and have NEVER had an issue with my networks, despite transmitting far-higher resolution video and better sound)Thee Ring support folks simply hang on the thought that somehow it is my network and NOT their faulty device. If you're OK with having to buy one of these every 9 month or so, it's great, but their warranty is absolutely worthless and will do nothing but frustrate you. I'm now investigating the Google device as a replacement. Really disappointing...\",\n",
       " 'I purchased this as a doorbell because my doorbell is installed on vinyl siding. People don’t realize they have to push my original doorbell really hard so It would never ring and I would not know they were there. With Ring I not only hear them I see them! I also can check out my door live from work if I choose. I did not get II or the pro but I probably would get II if I get another for the upgraded camera. This one works just fine for my purposes but my house is set back so far it would allow a clearer view.I used Scotch outdoor double sided tape to install on the aluminum trim and didn’t hard wire it to my door bell because I am renting and didn’t want to drill holes plus the siding wouldn’t have allowed it to sit flush.Setting it up was very easy and I’ve had to play around with the settings because if you have it on motion and alert, depending on what setting you have it goes off a lot. Squirrel  movement, cars going by, etc. I forgot to turn off the alert at bedtime and it went off a couple times that night like 2 something and 4am. When I played it back you could hear an animal ( probably a deer) on the drive.I’ve gotten it worked out now.🤗Any lags or delay in opening the view have been because of my WiFi which is not great so that needs to be boosted, but for my needs it works great! Placement is tricky if you are using the camera for more then just the door but if your door isn’t offset, it would really cover your whole front. More then I expected from just a doorbell! I am very pleased. I haven’t used it to talk to anyone yet but I’m sure that works fine.',\n",

What good is it if you can only see what’s happening now?I looked at the subscription and it is $3 a month. Not bad one might say.

       " \"I don't have a door bell so I figured I might as well get one with video and some other neat features.  It may be a great surveillance gadget but as a door bell it sort of sucks.  There is a huge lag between someone pushing the ring button and Alexa (Amazon smart speaker) making a sound.  Maybe its just me but a multi second lag is not terribly desirable for a door bell.  Same goes for the announcement of movement, there seems to be a relatively long delay.I already set it to the most sensitive setting which will probably run the battery down.This gadget beats having no door bell but had I known how it actually performs I would not have purchased it.  Now that I have installed it I might as well keep it...UPDATE:I did not expect anyone from RING nor anyone else to pay much attention to my experience.  I was completely wrong, a technical expert from RING got a hold of me and helped troubleshoot the system.  They actually sent me a replacement product within a day or so after they did remote analysis.  The Ring doorbell now works as advertised.  I did end up running a power wire to the doorbell so I would no longer have to recharge the battery.  While the battery does last a few days it is just easier this way.Excellent after sale support by RING !!!\",\n",
       " \"I purchased this a few months ago, and found that, initially, it would not connect to my Xfinity Router.  I exchanged many emails with the Tech Support at Ring, but they were essentially stymied.  I even purchased another Ring Video Doorbell, in case the first one was defective.  I had the same issues with the second one (not connecting).  Finally, after so many attempts using their app to connect, I pressed the button in the middle of the process (which it did not say to do), and this, somehow, allowed the connection to complete.  I finally have this attached to my front door.  I have it set to record both motion and doorbells, and it works well.  I am alerted that there has been a motion, and a 30-second video of the event is uploaded from the cloud so I can review it. (I would like it to start recording when someone approaches rather then when they are walking away.)  I find that a car in the road often sets off the motion detector, so I will try to reduce the sensitivity radius to more accurately reflect actual valid motions.  The video is not particularly good quality, and doesn't match what is shown in the ads.  I don't see a way to increase quality. I ordered an external ringer so I could hear the doorbell in other rooms.All-in-all, I consider this to be a good buy and quite useful.\",\n",

If you want to set up the doorbell, just as a doorbell that you can see who rings it and to speak to them once they\\'ve rung - no problem. It will do that without a subscription. out of the box \"free service\". Now if you are more curious than that - and you want to look at past events... you will have to subscribe for the \"Ring Protect Plan\". Meaning - if the motion is detected, but you don\\'t get to the phone in time - you will have a video to view what set it off by paying for the subscription. If you don\\'t subscribe, you can only view live feed.The subscription is not very expensive, and you can cancel at any time, but it is the principle of the matter.So that was the question I had - and I hope this is a helpful review!',\n",
       " \"We love our ring doorbell. My son has Tourettes syndrome and was being bullied by some local children, they were leaving hurtful notes on our doorstep. We initally got the ring doorbell to catch the kids in the act, but it's usefulness has gone far beyond catching neighborhood kids.We are notified when packages arrive so they are not left out long, we haven't had a package stolen since we've purchased the doorbell.The neighborhood app is amazing, you can see what crimes have happened in your neighborhood, but it does beyond that. Lost dogs are posted, be on the lookouts are posted, it's a great community of neighbors almost like an online neighborhood watch.We love the connectivity with Alexa, our echo announces movement at the door, so no matter where we are in the house we receive the notifications.If you are on the fence, check out the app first. The app is free and you don't need to pay for the recording service. You can use the app and doorbell for free if the $3 a month isn't in your budget. They have made security and peace of mind accessible to everyone.\",\n",
       " \"Updated review 3 stars 6/2016:The first few months or so were great. The Ring worked really well for me. It was pretty quick to notify mine and my wife's phones, it also recorded pretty quickly upon motion detection, and the video quality was decent enough. Sound and microphone needed some customized settings that Ring's cuatomer service took care of. By the way, customer service is pretty decent. They try to help and to explain things well.Unfortunately, after the first few months, things just didn't work out so well. I thi k there was an update which screwed things up. Basically, the notifications take upwards of 10 seconds to reach our phones, there is now a very long delay before it recognizes motion even though it is set at its highest sensitivity, the recorded video not only starts very late (like 6 seconds late) but it then records for 1 second then freezes for 13 to 16 seconds while audio continues then continues video then freezes again. Live View is also a new feature that allows a Ring owner to check a live feed without the Ring needing to be activated by motion or by someone pressing the doorbell. It also takes about 20 seconds for it to connect even while on the same wifi. Customer service sent me a new unit which mever solved the problem. I think they are at a lost but don't want to say that. Instead, they keep telling me that my speed or signal may be the problem but I have verified that numerous times with them that is not the case. The speed requirement is at least a quick ping, and 1 Mbs upload. Lol... My ping was 16 ms while download is about 95 Mbs and upload is about 16 Mbs all standing outside with the door closed right next to my Ring. My wifi router is about 10 feet away and in direct sight of the Ring minus the wooden front door. They did do someth4on their end and it fixed the issue greatly to the point that I was content once again, but 3 weeks later things just got bad again. I have a top of the line tp-link router and have confirmed so many times at all times of the day and night that my wifi is not the issue. I also have two wireless cameras in the house much further away from the router that have no issues whatsoever.Original review (5 stars) approximately 12/2016:And this is the one I pick!A few months ago I decided to get a wireless camera for my front door.  I tried a number of IP wireless cameras including D-Link DCS-2132L, D-Link DCS-932L, iZtouch, Vimtag 361HD, Foscam C1, and Samsung SmartCam HD Pro.  I set up the Ring video doorbell alongside some of the aforementioned cameras.  Needless to say, I found the Ring to be most useful for my needs.I must say it now so you know, too.  The Ring video doorbell was not designed to act as a security camera like the others.  Comparing the features and quality of optics, etc. just doesn't make sense all that much.  Sure, the optics could be better, but the Ring gets the job done.  I can clearly identify people at my door.The number one feature that had me pick the Ring video doorbell over my other camera configurations is because it acted somewhat as an intercom between myself or wife and someone at the door.  If someone goes to my door at night when I'm still at work and my wife is home alone with the kids, I can virtually answer the door.  The person at the door has no clue if I'm home or not.  On top of that, they know that I know what they look like and that there is a good chance they are being recorded.We've also had visitors meet at the house earlier than expected... I'll have to continue my review in a little while.\",\n",
       " \"Great video doorbell. The included instructions allowed me to install this video doorbell in less than 20 minutes. It was a bit larger then I expected, but if I would have read the dimensions before purchasing I wouldn't have been surprised. Although it is a bit large, it is very aesthetically pleasing.The wifi setup was simple, and the application to view your doorbell video or recordings is intuitive. The notifications are delivered quickly most of the time, but sometimes there is a 2-3 second delay. I don't think the delayed notifications is much of a concern, because the doorbell is still recording the second it detects motion, and you can view the video recording in the app.This doorbell adds security piece of mind when your not at home or having packages delivered. It is also fun to see what some people do when they are standing outside of your door!\",\n",
       " \"The bell is good. It was not easy for me to install due to my door frame being narrow. I had to buy a separate angle kit for it. That took 2 days to arrive. After that it was easy to install. Connection to wifi and charging were also easy.It works fine. Alerts me when someone approaches. The bell is loud and detects motion. I like the live 2 way audio.The problems :- motion detectionIt's kinda hit or miss. There are times when I am dancing in front of it and it won't send a notification to my phone and other times it will pick up every car on the road.- connection problem.The live view is amazing if it works. Sometimes I just can't connect to the bell and it gives me an error. Doesnt matter how close i am to the bell, if I am using wifi or lte, its also a hit or miss.So 3 stars. Hopefully a software update will fix it.\",\n",

That being said, I am forgiving and I understand if some installations are harder.My installation had a doorbell perpendicular to the door so I had to order an angle/wedge. My door is about 5' high instead of 4' off the ground because of the stoop.I installed the Ring doorbell with the angle/wedge mount and was able to get it completely wired up very quickly. It's a little too high which means that it's showing motion on some vehicles at the road (about 30') away.This is tuneable. I could tune it and I've tested it and it does work.

I wish we could have gotten the other version but we don't have a wire for power.We had some issues initially with the product including it stopped working but support was more than amazing and quickly sent out a replacement. I was very impressed.We have had this for several months and I love being able to get alerts for people ringing our doorbell or randomly checking in on our house. I also love knowing when people walk by although I wish we could fine-tune the monitored area better. The battery does great with how much it goes off, we have a decent amount of traffic, but it doesn't take long to recharge and it goes back outside.Installation was quick and easy and it works great. I do recommend getting their wifi extender and charger. There does seem to be an issue with how well it picks up routers regardless of how no other electronic device we have has ever had issues picking up the signal outside but to me a small price to pay for a piece of mind.They update the product regularly and we can now share videos with those around us which is great if someone in our neighborhood has an unwanted visitor they want everyone else to know about.Overall a great product. A very satisfied customer and I think we will always have these around. I think it has been well worth the investment.\",\n",
       " \"We have had the Ring Doorbell for about three weeks now. The first thing we had to do was buy a wifi extender because we did not have a strong signal on the front porch where the doorbell was placed.  We bought one that was recommended by Ring and it was inexpensive and easy to install and works well. We also bought the Ring Chime with the doorbell since we do not have a wired doorbell.We bought the Ring for the doorbell function and I would rate that as adequate. It works reliably and the chime is loud enough to hear throughout the house. The problem comes with the user interface with our mobile devices. I am not sure if the issue is with the Ring app or is a problem with the device operating system.On our iPad, as long as the Ring app is open and on the screen, when the doorbell rings there is an immediate view through the Ring camera for me to respond to. If the app is closed or open but minimized, I can choose (in the iPad notification settings) for a notification window to pop up. I can then click on the pop up and I am immediately taken to the Ring camera screen. That is a workable interface.On my Samsung Android phone, which is what I have with me when I am not home, the interface is problematic. As with the iPad, if the app is open and on the screen, I have an immediate view through the Ring camera when the doorbell rings. However, if the app is closed or open but minimized, I get a banner notification on the top of the screen that almost immediately disappears. As a result, there is a multi step process to get to the Ring app in order to answer the Ring. Again, I don't know if this is a limitation of the Ring app or the Android OS.  If anyone knows how to answer with one touch, please respond.Although we did not buy the Ring for the Motion Sensing feature, we thought it might be a useful bonus.  Unfortunately, it is practically useless. The over riding flaw is that it is inconsistent, so trial and error tweaks with its settings and with the physical placement of the doorbell are impossible to carry out.  After several days of attempting without success to set it so that it picks up motion as people enter the porch, I finally gave up. Like others have said, the motion detection starts very late so that you only see someone as they are leaving or it does not work at all when someone approaches. Maybe in one out of twenty five approaches, the recording starts early enough to see who the person is. For this reason, I will not be subscribing to the cloud recording service. There does not seem to be any point to it. If they are able to fix this problem, then we will reconsider.In summary, buy it if you want a doorbell, look elsewhere if you need motion activated recording.Edit:  After using this for almost three months now, I am upgrading my review of the doorbell function.  Getting used to the interfaces took some practice but is easier now.  I have answered the door while away from home a couple of times and it worked great!  When I am home, I can view who is at the door to see whether I want to answer or not.I have also adjusted the placement of the doorbell by using a leveler wedge behind it to point it down slightly (see pictures).  This has cut down on some of the notifications for motion, but still not to the point that it is useful for our purposes.  However, if you are utilizing the motion detection, you should try this!\",\n",
       " \"Hello, experienced reviewer here. I've been buying online and off amazon for years and I always research products before buying them.Unfortunately this product just does not work that well.  If you read the other reviews you will see that it has significant software issues.  The two biggest and most frustrating are that passing vehicles will set off the motion detect regardless of motion settings and that there is a very significant time lag between when the motion video is activated and when someone approaches the bell.  In almost all cases you will only see a video of the person walking away and not catch their face.  Anyone who knows this about the product could exploit this issue and simply run and steal your mail knowing that the camera would only turn on after their face is turned away from the camera.Final advise: This bell does look nice and the app does notify you if someone rings your bell, but it fails to provide much increase in security. I would recommend waiting until a better product comes out (from what I hear the pro version of this product has the same issues).\",\n",
       " 'Got the ring door bell for my new house based on decent reviews. Installed the doorbell with hardwire option with no problems. Connected to WiFi with good signal.The video quality of the doorbell is fairly poor. I would compare it to early 2000\\'s cell phone camera. Then I started noticing issues with the motion detection not working properly, which was one of the main attractions for getting this door bell.At first I noticed that no matter how sensitive and how far/close I make the setting, the motion detection would still be catching passing cars on the street that is about 80 feet away from my door, which should be beyond the furthest setting of the bell.Next I noticed that the motion detection is random at best with noticing people movement on my porch. First I noticed that a delivery guy was pulling away in his truck after dropping off my package on the porch before I got notification about motion (yes excellent wifi signal and 120mbps internet connection), then I started noticing that I can walk through my door back and forth and stand on the porch without any detection of my presence.So I contacted Ring about my issues. The (email) response time of customer support is fairly quick, but sometimes rep would either be not knowledgeable or think that you are type of person that looks for \"Any Key\" on your keyboard. In any case, after few weeks of back and forth of changing settings (which I already tried 10 times my self) I finally requested to have a replacement bell sent to me. Which I was kind of skeptical about fixing the issue...When finally receiving a new door bell, I installed it and noticed right away that the quality of the video was even worse than the first one. To the fairly low quality of video, now I have blurriness added and even poorer night vision quality. As for the motion detection, it became slightly better, but again, nothing that you can rely on. I can still walk out or stand on the porch for a while before it finally detects me (or not).Take a look at the attached picture of the video quality. Look how blurry it is with ghosting of the porch supporting poles, etc.Knowing how it performs, I would NOT buy this door bell.',\n",
       " \"UPDATE: Don't buy this junk! The Ring Chime doesn't will always disconnect from the doorbell. I've contacted Ring's customer service and they have responded most of the times but I guess they finally gave up because they're not sure why their junk Chime doesn't work. They've sent me a replacement but still doesn't work. It's too late to return this garbage so I'm out some money on this purchase.Also, the Ring Doorbell no better either. They keep promising to bring live stream to non-hardwired applications...doubt the feature will ever be added. The doorbell seems to get worse and worse over time. The motion sensor picks up people as they walk away...such a bad user experience. I'm so disgusted with this company right now...once my year is up for the cloud storage I paid I am going elsewhere...hoping Skybell or August doorbells are better than this.I've had the Ring doorbell for about six months now and I love it and hate it at the same time. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it takes too long to connect the doorbell to your iPhone/iPad. I too have the fastest WiFi available and it still takes tok long. By the time connection is established, the person at the door is long gone 90% of the time. The notification is also to subtle. It would be better if the iPhone rang like an incoming phone call. But when your guest actually waits for you to answer it is one of the coolest things. I can remotely unlock the door from upstairs when paired with a Smart door lock.Another huge issue is the motion detection. I have it set to maximum sensitivity and I still usually get recordings of people's backside. Worthless if it's someone stealing the package from your front door.Lastly, I hear they are working on introducing live streaming. This is great but when?!?!? This is one of the biggest reasons why I don't recommend getting this doorbell and the sole reason why I haven't purchased the Stick Up Cam. Add this feature and I'm sure sales will increase drastically.If you're thinking of purchasing this product, I'd wait for a bit. But if you really need a video doorbell, it's probably your best option at the moment.\",\n",

The motiondetection feature is significant in that any time the Ring detects movement, it sends a message to your phone.Also, I added the Ring application to my phone, so I can watch her house for her and be notified of any activityin the house.  The internal rechargeable battery can last up to year on one charge.  Tech support is available 24/7 andvery helpful.

I have 2 issues, 1 with the motion sensor and 1 with the app. The motion sensor doesn\\'t start soon enough and the recording ends too soon.We had it record a driver pull up and the recording ended before he got out of his car.Yet it didn\\'t start back up again until he was walking back to his car.Missed the whole delivery. The app only had 1 owner so as my husband set it up I\\'m only considered a \"shared\" person. I have zero control over video deletions and alerts.Very frustrating.',\n",
       " 'I purchased the Ring video doorbell directly from Ring.com (on March 3, 2016) because the \"Ring Stick Up\" cam was not yet available at Amazon (see attached copy of my email receipt\". Also, I ordered the Ring Chime which acts like a tradational doorbell when someone rings the bell or motion is detected, the chime rings. The chime is necassary because otherwise, the only notifications you will receive will be on your smartphone, tablet or Windows10 computer.Total spent $456:- $199 - Ring Video Doorbell- $199 - Ring Stick Up Cam- $29  - Wireless Chime- $29  - Stick Up Cam - SOLAR CHARGING PANEL (Pre-order)- Problem 1 (Original Video Doorbell):- Started when we received the Video Doorbell, motion didn\\'t seem to work consistently. No matter what the settings were, most sensitive (approximately 30 feet according to app) and least sensitive (approximately 5 feet according to app), standing in front of the door waving my hand in front off the camera and you could flip a could to guess whether or not it would work. I called support and we went through updating the firmware, resetting and same result.- Support said they would ship out a replacement. Something that should be noted here, when I received the replacement doorbell, it came in a PRE-PRINTED BOX INDICATING, HERE IS YOUR REPLACEMENT. PLEASE PLACE YOUR OLD UNIT IN THE BOX AND RETURN.- If you think about this for a second, how many companies have RETURN CUSTOM PRINTED PACKAGING with return instructions on the box. This box can only be used for returns of defective product which would make one believe, there most be a LOT OF RETURNS if the had this printed up.- Sensitivity set to approximately 5 ft (least sensitive) you can set it to, cars, buses, garbage truck all set off an alert even though they are 35-40 feet from the Video Doorbell.- Problem 2 (Stick Up Cam):- Went through the setup and mounted the camera, NOT MORE than 10 feet from my Asus AS1900 Wireless Router in my office but approximately 20 feet off the ground and had similar issues; inconsistent motion triggers and activations.- Got on the phone and support said to reposition so it wasn\\'t \"so far off the ground\"....HUH!!!??? Why would this matter? Did it anyway.- Moved the cam directly over the back door and yes it now picks up motion but also picks up motion WHEN THERE IS NONE!!!- Condensation on the lens the first morning after install made video completely unviewable and it seemed as the day warmed and the condensation dissipated, that would trigger the recording and of course an alert on my phone.- ALMOST FORGOT about the VOICE interaction!!! HAHAHAHA!!! My cellphone has a louder speaker and there isn\\'t anyway to change a setting.- So now if the motion does work and does send you a notification that there is someone in your backyard, well you might want to ask them what they are doing....well, they WILL NOT HEAR YOU!Problem 3 (Replacement Video Doorbell):- Same exact issue as with the first cam.For anyone reading this thinking it must be my Wifi, NOPE!! I positioned a repeater not 8 feet from the doorbell on the inside wall. My signal strength is great but this device just isn\\'t doing what it says it will.- My Swann cameras picked up my mailman but the Ring Doorbell DID NOT????- Audio communication while it seems better than the Stick Up Cam, it is of course where you would have a doorbell and the person ringing the bell will only be maybe 4-10 feet away. With the doorbell it might be better but of course you have to get a notification before UPS/FedEx or the mailman leave with your package.This is a GREAT IDEA but the execution is REALLY POOR! This just isn\\'t ready for Primetime!! I was willing to forgive the FIRST Video Doorbell having issues but when the second exhibited exactly the same issues.Don\\'t say I didn\\'t tell you so!',\n",

For not having to walk to your door or answering your door while not at home, its not bad.  I don't think it's worth $30 a year to record my doorbell conversations, but I'm going to sign up for a couple of months and see if they can help me work some of the motion detection issues out.I wish I would have spent the money on a different camera system.\",\n",

They are easy to use and generally dependable and stay on-line.  I have been impressed with how quickly RING picks up on motion and gives the alert without false alerts.

       " 'While the Ring brings me piece of mind (I recently had a package stolen which led to this purchase), there are a number of things left to be desired with this product. I bought two- one for my front door and one for the back. I do not have either hooked up to my existing doorbell because my landlord would not like that. This means I have to use the battery feature. The front doorbell’s Ring battery seems to last 3X longer than my back one does... maybe a faulty Ring? I swear I charge it and within three days it’s dead. Very frustrating. Another disappointing feature is the motion detection. I have changed my motion settings every which way, yet still get notifications ALL day long indicating there is motion at my door when it’s really just a car driving by. Which is odd, because when someone actually is at my door, I don’t get notified until they are right up at the door, sometimes even when they are walking away. This doesn’t give you enough time to use the talking feature to stop someone from stealing a package. By the time you open up the Ring app, they’re gone! The night vision also sucks. It’s black and white and very hazy.I appreciate the idea of this product. It’s also user friendly and easy to install. I just wish there were some things fine tuned and I wish one of my Rings didn’t die so dang quick!!',\n",
       " \"I HATE this thing. It's a great concept and, when it works, I like it but I've had nothing but problems with it. It worked for about 8 months and then it works sometimes but mostly doesn't. It will go days without recognizing any motion at all and then suddenly alert on every passing vehicle 30 feet away. Then, when it does alert, my HD video is stuck on black and white. It used to be HD color but sudddenly changed to black and white and there are no settings I can manipulate to change it. So, I have a high tech doorbell that sometimes alerts to motion and broadcasts only in black and white.Now, all of this would be ok if the company cared and wanted to fix it. But, they have, by far, THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE DEALT WITH.  I've brought the problems to their attention and their only solution is to keep asking me to reset my device. EVERY TIME. The device is clearly defective but all they want to do is keep resetting it. And, by the way, resetting it is no easy feat. You have to remove the device completely, reset it, and then reinstall. It's quite the process.I used to really love this thing. I even bought them for gifts for others but, since mine has crashed out and dealing with the company is an exercise in futility, I now hate it. I cannot in good conscience recommend this thing to anyone. Great concept and great potential but horrible performance and worse customer service.UPDATE:After dealing with customer service, they are finally attempting to truely remedy the problem. We'll see how it goes. As I stated, when it works, I really like it but I need it to work more often.\",\n",
       " 'We are very satisfied with this product.First the pros: nearly 180 degree field of view lets us see who’s at the door despite having to hang it perpendicular to the door. It is very easy to install (though we did require a power drill) and comes with all the bits, screws, and mounts you’d need. The app is very easy to install and navigate. The two way communication is crisp and the video is clear. Live view is easy to access and great for seeing who is at the front door.The cons: the motion detection is quite poor. Our porch is very little and faces away from the street so we don’t get a lot of notices that aren’t vital, but it also rarely picks us up when we walk in. This bell is far more useful when someone actually rings it. If you’re expecting it to catch people walking up, I wouldn’t exactly count on it as it’s hit or miss.All that said, we’re very happy with the product as we got it on sale and it allows us to see who’s at the door (we don’t have a peep hole). It allows us to easily avoid meeting salesmen and others we don’t want to answer for. Can’t complain if you don’t need the motion detection. Great storage option for videos caught on motion or answered rings for just $3 a month too.',\n",
       " 'The setup and installation of this unit is very easy and there are many videos from the manufacturer that make the installation process really seamless.  This is one of videos that is helpful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1ZLRY7JVc).Setting up the unit to join the home WiFi is also simple enough.  You have to download the \"ring app\" on your IOS or Android and it has the setup feature in the app.  The ring device starts to advertise an SSID for WiFi that your IOS or Android has to join temporarily.  That allows the app to interface with the doorbell and configure it for the your personal WiFi network.The quality of the video is outstanding and very surprising with the 180 degrees coverage and how clear the video shows up.  some reviews on Amazon talk about delay or showing only the back side of the people as they leave.  However, I didn\\'t notice any of these issues.  Once the door bell rings I see the notification on my phone and iPad about half a second later.  When I answer the call the video shows up and both the video and voice quality is very clear.The unit comes with 30 days of cloud recording feature and additional $30 / year will buy the cloud video storage for safe keeping and just in case you can not answer the door at the time someone rings the bell but want to check later using the motion sensor and video recording feature.I wish the unit would have included at least one WiFi enabled Chime to allow the door bell ring inside the house as well.  But the chimes are sold separately and seems like they\\'re usually hard to find.  So I ordered two chimes directly from Ring at $29 each and they work great.  I have installed one on the main floor and the other on the second floor.  The chimes are configured the same way as the doorbell to add them to the home WiFi using the same Ring app on the IOS or Android device. Also each Chime unit can be configured to go off for either motion or door bell or both as well as you control the volume of each chime from the same app.',\n",

I received another call from Ring support and this time the person took time to understand the problem and reviewed the video quality on my account. Agreed that this is product failure and offered a replacement.I had this product installed at front door. For many months the video quality was extremely poor. The wifi signal was good.  tested by keeping close to router etc. I sent few emails from ring app but didnt hear back. Finally when i really needed to check on an event the quality was so bad that I couldnt see  anything. When through another round of testing with customer service and was told that device has gone bad, please purchase new device. This  worked or barely an yr. if you spread cost over an yr, its very costly device. On top of that the monthly fee for video.If it would have lasted, i was happy with it. but would NOT recommend ring products if they are designed to go out in an yr and asking customer to upgrade or buy again.',\n",

Now it won’t turn back on at all or connect. Called the help desk to be told nothing can be done about it. It’s a month passed the one year warranty and WILL NOT be replaced or fixed.  After almost 20 mins on the phone with the help desk, I’ve been offered a discount on a future purchase.

We are experiencing single digits at the moment, and the battery actually lasts 6 to 12 HOURS in this type of weather.  After experiencing failure two days ago, I brought my unit inside to warm up, and recharge overnight.  Next day, with a high of +8f, I got exactly 8 hours of use out of this thing before it shut itself off because the battery was dead.

       " \"I had high hopes for the Ring, but it has turned out to be a disappointment.WiFi: The most annoying thing is that whenever it loses WiFi connection, you have to physically disconnect the ring from your front door, push a reset button on the back, go through the whole set up process on your cell phone, and reconnect the device to your door. Why??? Every other smart home device I own (Nest, indoor cameras, not to mention my computer or cell phone) can momentarily lose WiFi connection and reconnect automatically without me doing anything. If I'm out of town and my Ring loses WiFi connection, it's absolutely useless until I get home. Isn't that the whole point of having the Ring? That I can check it while I'm away?The second-most annoying thing about the Ring is that it will record any passing car even if I set the field of motion to be pretty narrow. At the same time, I'll have visitors come into my home and the Ring doesn't record them approaching the house -- it only starts recording after the door is open and they are walking in, so you can't even see who it was that entered. This means it would be useless in the case of a break-in.So, if you don't have a 100% bullet proof WiFi connection, don't get this. And if your main motivation is to have a security camera (and you live in an urban area) then I wouldn't recommend it because it'll record what you don't want (cars) and not record what you do want (people).If you have really solid WiFi outside your home and you only want this as a doorbell, then it should work fine.\",\n",

On the other hand, rarely do people on our front door step (where the mechanism is located and which is in the center of its field of view, and which is the reason we bought this device) trigger an 'event'. In other words, it records when nothing is happening and fails to record when something is directly in front of it. Perplexing. I'm not a fan.\",\n",

So back to the $99 Ringbell...Because I have an electric outlet near the front door, I was able to attach the USB charger to the back of the Ringbell, enabling it to always have electric power. I had to use approx 3 inch screws to hang the Ringbell to the wall, in order to compensate for the charger being inserted to the back of the Ringbell.

       " \"Overall, I was impressed as to how the Ring doorbell functions. It does everything that it says it does. The results of detection, video, picture quality, and notifications are good. The detection, someone walks up to the door without pushing the button, is pretty good and adjustable on the range of detection, but can get false positive depending on what and how much moves in front of your house. One thing that is bad right now is the picture adjustments for bright backgrounds. My Ring is in an alcove looking out to a front yard. Since the alcove is covered and darker than the bright outside, anything beyond the threshold of the alcove is just a white mess. Having some auto white balance in record mode would be good and/or manual while in live mode; neither exists and there are no picture tuning settings which is surprising. The recording feature is to their cloud, which I'm not crazy about. There is no alternative. To access those videos, you need to pay a monthly/yearly fee; after the 30 day trial, but at least be credit card is required at startup. That is an issue to me. Every company wants $5/$10/$20/... per month for continued service. I understand the business model or recurring income, but I as a consumer I do not want to pay that for each niche product I buy. So, you do get notifications for free, I think, but not video. Still, overall, the product does work well and its integration with using an existing doorbell power line and activation of internal doorbell is well done and worked perfectly for my existing installation. The installation instructions were pretty good and setup was fairly painless but does require that you understand how to switch networks on your mobile phone to initially connect to the device during out of the box setup and should only be required once for each device. Overall, I like it for what I paid. At the normal ~$200 price, it's a bit much for what you are getting; especially if you consider the extra monthly fee. Also, the box is not big, but it is much bigger than a typical door bell button fixture, so it kind of sticks out like a sore thumb next to the door; even with the color selections.\",\n",

       " 'This was easy to install. I thought hooking it up to our old doorbell insured it to work off the existing electricity. It doesn’t. Needs to be removed to charge at least twice a month. Doesn’t ring our doorbell, only sound comes through my phone. If I’m not home or near my phone, we don’t hear the doorbell. You have to buy another chime doorbell from them to work inside your house.Ring worked great the first 2 weeks while we were on vacation, but went dead before we came home.After the first month, if you don’t subscribe to a monthly payment, it doesn’t work at all.If I had known all this before, I would not have purchased it.  We are ready to hook up the old doorbell. This is inconvenient and too much hassle. This was a very expensive toy that lasted a few weeks.',\n",
       " 'Works pretty much as advertised; two \"buts\" knock it down to four stars: (1) It repeatedly complains of poor WiFi connections, while working fine at other times, even though I have a very simple WiFi setup (a single access point, no mesh, very little variability in number of devices on the network); and (2) in cold, winter weather, the battery doesn\\'t stay charge for more than two to three weeks, which is not a major issue. A limitation of which I was not aware at the time of purchase is that live talk is not available for battery operation; your Ring doorbell needs to be wired to old-fashioned, AC doorbell wiring to enable that feature. Given the short delivery times drivers are allowed for each delivery, that means the driver has gone by the time you respond to a ring alert and start the video (which comes not from your Ring doorbell, but a cloud service).',\n",

Tech help advised the hard wire only provides enough power to SLOWLY recharge the battery and it was using too many features and a lot of activity. By the time we figured this all out the return window had closed. We are stuck with a product that doesn\\'t do anything near what it advertises.

       " 'The Ring Video Doorbell is actually made for use on a house to replace your current traditional doorbell. But seeing we live in a motor coach, I had to of course install one. Hey, after all, it is our \"house\". The best news to me was that it actually can run on it\\'s internal, rechargeable, battery! Yup...That means no wires need to be run or holes made in the coach. The batteries recharge via USB port and last for a very, very, long time. I have had this installed for over two months now and the battery is still at 85%!What does it do you may ask? Well, when someone presses the button, it rings an app on your smartphone (Android or iPhone). From that app you can see the person at your door no matter if you are home or not. If you care to then chat with the person, you can do that via it\\'s built in speaker and mic. Even if you choose not to, it records the video onto a cloud storage area. Now the service does cost for the storage, however it is only $30 a year. (That\\'s cheap.) So that means even if you miss the call, your still get a video of anyone that pays a visit.It even has motion sensitive areas. So you can setup zones for it to watch for motion and if detected, it will send you an alert and record the video. We do not do this however, for we do not need it to send us a notice and make a video every time we go in and out of the coach.All in all, see the video I did talking a little about it and showing you how it works on our coach.

       " \"We purchased a Ring doorbell and two Chimes almost a year ago.  It was very easy to install and set up.  We did have to get the wifi extender due to it's distance from our router.  It has worked very well.  One can easily customize the area it covers so it doesn't pick up unnecessary motion.We had a large carved eagle set up next to our door.  One early morning it was stolen and the Ring caught the thief on video.  The Ring had alerted us,but we thought it was just the newspaper delivery service and ignored it.  Even though we thought we'd never see the eagle again, we reported the theft and shared the video with the Coon Rapids police.  They, in turn, posted it on their Facebook page.  They received several tips from the public.  The eagle was located and returned to us the same day the video was posted.  In fact, our local news channels covered the story as it unfolded.  The Associated Press recently included our story as part of an article they published about video doorbells and cameras.We are sold on the Ring and have just ordered a camera for our backyard. The small cost of the monthly fee is well worth it to have the ability to retrieve the video.\",\n",
       " \"1st off before buying the ring doorbell I had to convince my wife that it was necessary we needed it.  Once I receive the ring doorbell the insulation and set up procedures were fairly easy. But then came the problems. The 1st problem was we were receiving ghost doorbell rings at all hours of the day-and-night.  After a few rounds of troubleshooting with Tech Support and messing with the resistor they sent me a new one to replace the defective item. Unfortunately the new device did the same exact thing. The problems did not stop there. Before purchasing the ring door I made sure it could be installed with direct sunlight, but during the day in direct sunlight my screen goes black and returns after the sun has past.  And the icing on the cake is you have to pay a monthly membership for your device not to work properly.  And for the cost of the ring doorbell  I was able to purchased two motion censoring 1080 Pan tilt zoom cameras with 2-way talk for front and back yard and still didn't pay as much as the ring doorbell.\",\n",
       " 'I had issues with this Ring-the video quality was very bad even with 200 mb/s internet speed and 10 ft away from the modem. The problem was mostly the location of my Ring. I rated it a 1-star. After some short time, Ring customer service (Danielle) contacted me via email to offer help. I thought to myself, “ya right, I am sure you’ll help”. Took some self-convincing but I contacted her. Wow, I must say she absolutely was wonderful-very patient, respectful and helpful. At the end, I ended up upgrading with a minimum charge but I love my Ring. This Ring is very basic so don’t expect a miracle. If you want the best go for a bit more expensive one (Ringdoor Pro, in my case).',\n",
       " 'This product is absolutely amazing! I live in a seedy area (not a terribly bad place, but still a bit seedy) and I\\'ve had packages/mail stolen in the past. With this, I\\'m able to view who is at my front door, or who even passes within 30 feet (a function you have to select.) You\\'re also able to view seedy happenings in the neighborhood (there is an area of the app that allows neighbors to post anything they see to alert neighbors.) I love that I can potentially talk to someone at my front door even if I\\'m not home, and I love that you can view and/or share footage of happenings. I also opted for their $3/month plan that allows you to store footage. I also love that you can personalize your alert tone....I have mine set so my phone tells me \"motion detected at your front door\" it\\'s better to me for an alert message because there\\'s no doubt that that\\'s what I\\'m being alerted about.The range of view you\\'re able to get on the Ring is amazing, it\\'s about 180 degree range, so there is no hiding from the camera, and no one can sneak up on our porch without us knowing.Also, I live in a very old home, and I was skeptical that I could even hook the Ring up to my doorbell after viewing the ancient wires, but it connected like a charm, and it keeps my unit charged. I\\'m able to view the battery power of the unit from my phone, and I\\'ve noticed it go down as far as 99% charged, and then pop back up to 100% after several hours of non-use. It does take a long time to charge when you first get it (I don\\'t think I saw anything saying you have to charge it up when you get it, but I had time on my hands waiting for my husband to wake up, so I went ahead and charged it up to 100% before we installed it.) Also, if you do ever need to recharge it on a charger, all you have to do is unscrew the 2 screws at the bottom, pull the main unit off the wall and charge it....there is a bracket that is screwed into the wall that will stay on the wall while you charge it.Another great thing is that you can see very well at night, with or without a porch light on. It gets pretty dark on my porch, so being able to see at night is a huge relief especially as I\\'m home alone at night a lot. I can take my phone to bed with me and view my front porch if I hear any noises.DOWNSIDES: For anyone who thinks you\\'ll be able to get the Ring and automatically see who is at the door, there is a 20 second delay. You have to opt to view the happenings, they will not just pop up immediately (you get a notification when there\\'s motion if you opt for motion detection, and you\\'ll receive notifications if someone rings your bell, but viewing the camera is not automatic, you have to click the button and wait for it to connect.)The picture can be a bit fuzzy at times, but it clears up, and when you talk through the doorbell, the person talking to you may be a bit garbled, but you can hear perfectly from the Ring.It feels like I often can\\'t get the video to open as quickly as I\\'d like, I  have to close the app and wait and reopen it, or restart my phone....it will either give me a black screen, or the button won\\'t start loading the video, or it will start loading the video and it\\'ll take a long time.....this doesn\\'t happen every time, but it is frustrating at times.The biggest downside for me is that you can not talk to the Ring from the Echo Show, but you can view the camera from the Echo Show, so that\\'s a plus.All in all, I think the upsides far outweigh the downsides, and I truly love this product.',\n",
       " \"The unit I received positively would not sense and alert on any movement coming directly towards it.  It detected movement to the extreme right or left but nowhere else.  Id did activate when the doorbell button was pushed but that wasn't the kind of performance that Ring seems to advertise.  Their tech person was friendly enough and sent me a vertical shim kit so the Ring would see less up and more down.  There are no specs on how close to vertical the Ring has to be mounted and after I asked their tech I never heard back from him.The shims did not improve the motion detection to acceptable response, actually didn't improve anything so I returned it to Amazon.  Thanks you Amazon.The lens on the $100 unit provides a fairly sharp image but it is a very fish-eyed view not at all good with a phone and a bit better on an Ipad but not like what you see on the TV ads.I'd have to say it is over hyped and try a different brand.\",\n",
       " \"I just wanted a good, well-made, basic security doorbell that didn't cost much so I did some research and pricing. This Ring wi-fi enabled doorbell seemed to be the best to fit my needs. A friend installed it for us in about five minutes. (One thing to note: make sure you set up your phones first with the app before the doorbell cover is screwed in place. It's easy to unscrew and remove, but that's a pain.) We all tested it out and it worked perfectly with our hundred-year-old doorbell chimes.Usage: the directions in the app are very easy and it gives you a lot of options. We all tried it out and the pictures are clear and the voice reception very good. Great at nighttime also. As for the reception, our router (not a high-end  five year old router) is in the middle of the house on the second floor and we haven't had problems with the video, so I'm not bothering with a signal booster.My only wish is that it was a bit smaller width and lengthwise, and that there were a few more choices of covers (antiqued or whatever)  but that's not a problem, more of an aesthetic issue for me, as I live in a Craftsman-style house.All in all, a definite thumbs-up.\",\n",
       " \"If you want to skip the long review watch the video and let that speak for itself (every Ring video mine takes looks like that). The review is just the detail and support hell I went through as to my reason I gave it two stars.Bought mine via their website. It kinda works. However it failed me at it's one advertised feature! You'll note the person's face can't even be seen despite being in perfect view of the camera. It's all pixelated. I called support about this. Nothing they could do (had hoped they had a better quality version to no avail). Their questions were to state that the issue was with my WiFi (I am a network admin and I KNOW it's not due the router, the RING being the ONLY thing with a crappy connection).I have a 200Mbps line and the access point sits 7.5 feet from the Ring doorbell on the other side of the wall. I have devices 30+ ft away in the house through 2-3 walls that have solid connections I get a FAIR connection in my backyard which is 65 feet away through 3 walls 2 of them concrete. The Ring is only separated by a single wooden/sheetrock wall/doorframe. This is of course consistent behaviour with the device. The quality is like this on ALL videos. I had to buy a separate camera higher res camera to compensate. Basically using the Ring as an intercom at this point as the video has proven to be useless for it's intended purpose. Whether it's at night or in the day time its generally the same quality video.I tried working with their support and just got fed up as they kept trying to pin it on my network (which works for EVERY device in the house EXCEPT the RING thats the closest wifi device to the router). I gave them a bandwidth test and when it did not show that my connection was bad, they tried to send me to other ones until they got the result they wanted (they did not). Basically tried to pass the buck on to me. So if you want an intercom, this works well for that. For actual surveillance and security? Get something else. A dedicated camera paired with this will work just fine. I bought two surveillance cameras with POE injectors and WiFi Adapters for less than the price of the Ring. Those are doing a FAR superior job.\",\n",
       " 'It has been a month with our ring I am not very impressed.  It is facing straight down the center of our completely level 30 foot long walk way to our front door. Sometimes it picks up motion at the end of our walk other times it won’t pick up motion until someone is five feet from our door. It never fails to pick up cars in the street 55+ feet away though. One solicitor was able even to get up to the door leave a letter and walk away without ever being detected. But it caught the garbage truck.  When the mail carry delivers packages it sure catches them dropping them off but never catches their faces or them walking up. It is great if someone rings the actual doorbell but if you are trying to catch a package thief, good luck.  Don’t mind that taxi in the roadway though.Video quality is only okay. If the is just in the wrong spot it makes the video vary grainy.TL/DR: would not by this again. Picks up cars in the street but not people approaching the door on a level walkway. I may try a better one though.',\n",

The price is great, and saving a video to your phone is easy enough.I got the security system first, and I always wanted the doorbell camera, so I had it on my wish list.  I received the Ring doorbell 2 for xmas - but I returned it and got the older model instead since the viewing angle is wider.  Installation was a breeze, and connecting to the device to wifi is very easy through the Ring App.  I ended up getting a generic adjustable corner mount for it for $10 since it mounted directly against the wall - so half my picture was brick.I replaced a standard doorbell with this, and it's hardwired to my old doorbell chime - it will ring the doorbell like a normal button would, but then also ring on all my Alex devices and phones!\",\n",

Since it rings on my phone but not in the house, I also bought the Chime Pro with a wifi extender.  This is a really cool idea but a very flawed execution.1.  The Chime stopped working pretty quickly; it doesn't ring inside anymore.  The doorbell is linked to the extender and it seems to be good, but not as good as the Belkin extender I had it hooked up to before.2.  Even if I adjust the range to be the narrowest available, it still seems to catch the motion of cars passing on the street or someone walking their dog on the sidewalk many times a day.3.  The battery life is really short.  I am often away for 4-8 weeks at a time.  The battery will fade after a month, which means until I can get back and charge it, the Ring is dead/useless.4.  You are also unable to trouble shoot or make any adjustments remotely.  You have to physically have the Ring in your hand to push a switch before any further troubleshooting steps can be taken.  Again, if it malfucntions while you're away, you can't do anything till you're home again.5.  It used to give me a reasonable amount of time to respond when I heard the chime -- you have to pick up your phone, hit your home button, click the ring app -- and could usually get the image; but then it started becoming shorter and shorter period, till sometmes now even if I have the phone in my hand and take the appropriate steps as quickly as possible, I am likely not to get the image.6.  The Ring is delayed. As I approach my door, I do  not hear the ring.  I can open the door, go inside and walk halfway up the stairs before I hear the chime and the video -- of the empty porch -- becomes available.7.  There is always quite a wait for customer serive.  They're usually very nice, though, when you reach them.All in all, it's cool when it works and you can see what's going on outside your door.  But the product needs much furher work to be effective.\",\n",
       " 'It would never notify us until like a minute later and by then whoever was at the door would be gone. It was constantly lagging. When it would alert us that someone was at the door we would go to view the video and the video would have an error so we wouldn’t even be able to view it. It was completely pointless. Worst waste of money. I logged into return it today and it was a week past the return window (which is less than a month) so now I’m stuck with a useless object. The doorbell function didn’t even work half of the time.',\n",
       " \"There's enough reviews on the unit itself, so I won't go on about that - it's not perfect but it is one of the best of it's class right now.  What really puts the Ring video doorbell over the top is that they  have a Windows 10 app (most competing products do not have one yet).  Being able to get alerts on any device I'm using at the time (and not JUST my phone) is a true game changer.  This way if I'm working at my desktop or laptop, I can view and respond directly to any alerts w/out switching to my phone.  Also being able to view the video on a big screen instead of just a tiny little phone screen is great.  On top of that, I can now leave live view of the video up on my PC as much as I want and not worry about draining my phone battery.  It's a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app so it works great on any size device from a full desktop to a laptop to a tablet or even phone, and potentially any other device that comes along in the future.  Hopefully they'll let it run on the Xbox One soon too!\",\n",
       " 'It works great for the first 30 days during the trial period where it saves 30 second recordings, and lets you review them and share them.  The Ring ecosystem is bait and switch, pure and simple. After the 30 day trial is over, the Ring is virtually useless.  Any movement or alert still comes through to your phone, but it\\'s live video only.  The delay of several seconds means that whatever person has come, or package was dropped, or prankster/theif has come - has already happened, and you can\\'t see anything but the backside of a person running away, or nothing at all. You\\'re left wondering - \"what caused this alert\".  Also, it will not connect to Alexa or amazon devices. I got this in July and tried for a few weeks/months off and on to get it to connect to an Echo Dot, and a Fire TV box, but nothing. Nothing at all.  Buyer beware, afaik Ring lies about Alexa compatibility and sets up a bait & switch for their paid monitoring subscription service.  Don\\'t buy a Ring.

I don't think there are any other non-Ring options that are battery powered either.Installation: Not had...Was a little tricky mounting because it wasn't exactly flat so had to try a bunch of different ways before it slid up into the mounting bracket.Sensitivity: I was a little worried that it wouldn't catch people because there are stairs leading up to the doorway but it gets the vast majority of people in time. I think the only way it would miss someone is if they sprinted up my steps, went to my front door and then dashed back down the steps.Video quality: Pretty decent.  Not as good as the new version but good enough for you to tell who's at your door.Sound quality: Not great. Have had some conversations with people at the door and it's hard to hear them, kind of like when you have bad redemption on your phone, and it seems hard for them to hear you to. Totally doable though.Do you need this? You didn't think you did but after you get it you'll wonder how you lived without it. Incredible piece of mind seeing everyone who comes to your door. Seems like it probably dissuades would-be troublemakers too once they realize they're on camera.\",\n",

Also, it's very annoying to have to recharge the battery.  Since we've owned it, I've had to fully charge the doorbell twice.  So twice in 6 months.  We do live in front of a street, so the motion detection will pick up cars.  I've adjusted those settings but I wish it could be even more configurable.  Also, we live in the Chicagoland area and it got super cold in January and February, which probably contributed to the battery life.  Nothing we can do about that.  Overall, I'm happy but I really wish we connected it to the home power vs using it on battery.  Oh, it also takes a long time to fully recharge the battery (... hours).

My handyman followed that and I cannot fault him for not using his common sense.i suggest you stand in front of the position of the doorbell and estimate if that will be a good angle to capture your audience before installation. we realized in hindsight it should be in a spot free of obstruction (ring now faces the roman pillar directly in front of the door bell instead of a clear view). to uninstall and reinstall in a better spot will cost me more money so i just left it.After downloading the app etc, took a few tries to figure best angles and distance that works. If too far, it captures every moving vehicle from the neighbors' . if too close, it does not video the people walking towards the house. so i just left it a the farther angle which means the video kicks off very often and my ring bell alert sound very often unnecessarily..it is very useful in many other ways and I wish i had it long ago.It has been only a few months and i had asked it to be hard wired. we will see if the replacement battery runs out etc in a few more months.\",\n",
       " '9/22/16I would like to say this device is perfect however that is not that case. I really like the idea of the Ring Doorbell but it comes with a few flaws that you should be aware of.1. The motion function engages when people are walking away, not when they walk up, unless that walk really, really slow. MANY of my videos are of people\\'s backsides. I have UPS and FedEx deliver to me daily and I never get their face unless they actually press the ringer button. I don\\'t know if this is a software issue or cheap chip set.2. Too many false alerts. At first my wife and I thought it was kinda cool but now it drives use Bat$&!* Crazy! The damn alerts go off non-stop and now we react to them like the boy who cried wolf.I would like to state that I have had the Ring doorbell since May of 2016 and tried every setting on the device but nothing seems to make it function as described/advertised. I have poured through Ring\\'s tech support pages and googled other information that is non Ring to try and find a resolve. To include that my WiFi single is nothing less than 2MB upload speed, to ensure this I have my Ring Doorbell device on a dual band (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz) repeater to my dual band WiFi router. This way it can go between both bands singles always getting the strongest one.3. They tell you if your Ring is \"hardwired\" that you do not need to ever charge the device battery.....WRONG! It maybe because of all the false alerts or Ring does not know their device well enough but it drained the battery on the Ring Doorbell causing my doorbell chime to constantly go off on it\\'s own.4. Customer service so far has been very lack-luster. It took them 2 months to respond back to my tech issue then all I got was an excuse from the representative at Ring. Sorry but apparently they don\\'t know what they are doing once again. Excuses for a delayed response is unacceptable when it has been that long.Things I do like about it:1. When someone actually walks really, really slowly up to my door then I get get a good video of them.2. When someone actually pushed the doorbell and I am not home, I can communicate with them. Also when I am being super lazy and sitting on my couch I can tell them to go away.Bottom line is Ring needs to make good on their advertisement of the Ring Doorbell and either replace all the defective or portly made devices with better hardware or refund all it\\'s customers their money back who are unhappy with the outcome. In all fairness it takes over 30 days for you to try different settings and give a valid test before you know if it works for you or not. My 30 day window has past so now I am stuck with this device that in my opinion partially works. If that is good enough for Ring and they only care about their bottom-line then I guess the rest of us are stuck with a mediocre product.',\n",
       " \"NOTE: Review by Andrew's wife, Karen.  I purchased Ring as an assist for my private counseling practice.  I needed both a notification of a client's arrival and a means of viewing who was on the other side of our interior lobby door, which is kept locked.  Ring fit the bill!  It was fairly easy to install (thanks to my husband!) and we had it up and running in no time.  By design, it is discrete and aesthetically pleasing.  The chime is loud but not annoying.  And it is very convenient that the alerts come to our phones (mine and business partner) when we are in the office but with other clients.  Even if a client doesn't ring the bell, the motion sensor detects and we are notified.  It is also reassuring to get the alerts when we are away from the office, after hours, when others might enter the office (such as cleaning crew or anyone with an access key).  One unexpected added benefit we experienced occurred after we experienced a theft from our lobby.  In fact, that's why I  purchased the Ring when I did.  As we reviewed future surveillance videos, created when motion was detected after hours, we saw someone enter our office, who was not authorized to be there. The person took some items and this scenario was recorded on several different occasions.  Because we had the video evidence that they had entered our office when not authorized to do so (the company requested the video), they were able to deal with that matter swiftly and in a way that eliminated that as a future concern. Ring is a great asset to us!  Highly recommend!!!\",\n",
       " \"This is actually of limited use.  It takes so long to connect (30-45 seconds) that it's essentially not possible to talk to anyone at the door, or see them while they're at the door, unless they're lingering there for some reason.  They're almost always gone before it connects.  In order to be able to look at a recording made of them, after they've left, you have to subscribe to Ring's service, and I don't want to do that.  The only thing it's really good for is letting me  know that someone's at the front door, even if they don't ring the bell, such as for package delivery.  That feature keeps packages from waiting outside for hours until they're otherwise seen.I think I'd look for another brand that connects faster.\",\n",

I’ve been on the phone three time totaling well over two hours and still have a non-working $100 doorbell.Last suggestion was maybe the brightness of the sun was the issue. The doorbell is not in direct or even indirect sunlight where located...it is under a roof on a porch on the north side of the house.Anyhow, after last go round with CS my cell battery died after over an hour troubleshooting and despite their having my phone number, I’ve heard nothing back.So, I have two doorbells to send back and will be returning the u opened Ring Security system also.This experience has been like a bad joke.',\n",
       " 'You can set this up to use its rechargeable (via USB) battery or connect it to existing doorbell wires as we have done where the battery recharges automatically.  The doorbell connects to your house wi-fi and can trigger the video on your cell phone automatically with a press of the doorbell button or from a configurable motion detector in the device.  From my iPhone, we\\'ve answered our front door to ask that deliveries be left in the back yard and spoke directly with the delivery person while we were in Thailand.  For a small monthly fee Ring will save your videos for a couple months and you can download any video from their \"cloud\" to save permanently as needed. This has all been perfect for us even before the Alexa integration.',\n",
       " \"I really like the Ring Doorbell. Although it's only 720p, I can still see everything in the field of view clearly and night vision is pretty decent for the price point.Build quality is really good! I love the proprietary screw for the battery. Great idea to prevent tampering. I do, however, wish I would have sprung for the newer version for 1080p and battery that comes out the front, instead of removing the whole device to recharge.About the only negative I would give this product is the motion sensor. It's better than some cameras I've had and you do have options to adjust the sensativity, but it still seems to trigger outside the detection area and picks up small movements such as trees moving or sunlight casting a shadow.Overall, though, the good heavily outweighs the bad and this is a great entry into home security and I plan to add Ring cameras and security system because you just can't find a better deal than $10/mo for cloud service and monitoring for all your devices.\",\n",
       " \"It works decent. However, there are glitches in the system. 1) When you click setting, neighborhood, location you cannot edit address alerts being sent. 2) You cannot blot out motion areas so if you have flags, bushes etc you constantly get motion alerts all day and night long! There are some other concerns also. I contacted ring.com to include Jaime the CEO and they/he failed to advise me when or if he will have this fixed. 4) The battery dies in 6 months or less. 3) Blink battery lasts 2 years where ring.com you have to charge 6 months or so. Blink on the other hand you can blot out areas motion detector is picking up movement etc... and the neighborhood alert you can change anytime you want. Also blink has many great options in the program which ring.com doesn't! Try blink XT2 is owned by Amazon has help 24/7/365 from a dedicated office at Blink and is surely much more superior to ring and you will love it any of the Blink cameras.\",\n",
       " \"This product is not worth it at all. Better off buying a camera with a hard-drive. The battery does not last long at all. Just a few days at times. Would not recommend this at all. The recording feature is not free and costs $3 per month if you need motion recorded. The motion sensor is absolutely worthless. We've been trying to make it work well for nearly a year, but it is not worth the effort anymore. It does not record motion of people walking to the door, but records motion of buses/trucks 50 feet away, even though we set our range to 20 feet at most. The quality is very low compared to security cameras. It's much worse at night as well.\",\n",
       " \"Big disappointment.  The concept and design are good, however the implementation is not ready for prime time yet.  After initial installation the unit performed well, however after two days and a few visitors & deliveries the unit failed to alert on any IOS or Android device.  All steps listed on the Ring support forums were tried multiple times, including full resets and reinstallations of the applications to no avail.  The device was given a static IP, access point reset and device was moved next to the AP, after a couple more attempts at a hard reset the unit began to work again however failed again once it was moved beyond a reasonable distance from the AP.  I did try to contact their support however was routed around a few times in the IVR and didn't want to wait - already spent a few hours trying to trouble shoot.  It's possible that speaking with someone would have helped, however for a device that was purchased as a supplement to my existing equipment it's just not worth the hassle or any more of my time - for the price point this shouldn't take that much troubleshooting.  It's going back.  If the platform is so unstable that it quits after a couple days, or the wireless range is as limited as it appears to be, I'd recommend waiting for the next generation or install an expensive wireless camera as an add on to a traditional doorbell.\",\n",
       " \"Installation: Hard to get all four holes lined up just right on a stucco wall. Would be much easier if the Ring back plate had slots rather than small round holes for the screws, so you could cheat the mounting plate to get it level. Also, the top right prong on the mounting plate wouldn't lock into the slot on the Ring doorbell (even before the plate was mounted on the wall), so there's a gap between the mounting plate and doorbell at the top, so the gasket doesn't form a tight seal, so rain can get it, and that's bad.Use: Sometimes the Ring doorbell senses motion right away. Other times I can do a complete waltz in front of the camera and it won't turn on. Also, there's a significant delay between when someone approaches the door and when the Ring doorbell alerts my phone and when the app manages to finally get a video on screen, even when I'm on wifi. I usually get an image on screen just in time to see the back side of the person who is walking away after standing in front of the door for a while. Other times, the Ring doorbell senses and connects very quickly. No rhyme or reason as far as I can tell.Reliability: The Ring doorbell worked fine for 3-4 days, then it disconnected from the network and I couldn't access it at all. The fix required removing the doorbell from the wall and physically pressing the orange reset button on the back. That's OK if the Ring doorbell is at your home, but if you're using it for a vacation or rental property, having to fly to the other location to manually reset the device is a big drawback.Integration: Sometimes the Amazon Echo Show will show a view from the doorbell, and sometimes not. The instructions say that Alexa may not be able to contact the Ring if it's been a while since someone was at the door. This means you generally can't use the Ring to get a view of what's going on outside unless someone actually rings the bell.Bottom Line: A decent device, and probably as good as any smart doorbell on the market today (spring 2018), and at a good price, but functionality and reliability aren't quite there yet. I could recommend Ring to a gadget lover, but not to my mother.\",\n",
       " \"Wish the product worked the way the commercial shows it.  I installed the Ring in my front porch, approximately 4 feet from my fios router - just outside my office wall.  I have a decent wifi signal - my laptop, cell phone and smart TV work great, and they are much further away than the Ring.  My issues are: 1) When someone rings the doorbell, I can see them after a slight delay - not a problem, but I can't hear them speak too well.  I hear like every other word.  And that's when I'm inside the house, maybe 30 feet away.  Not a very usable feature.  I haven't been able to see how it works when I'm away from the home.  But can't imagine it would be better.  2) The motion detection is unpredictable.  It gets set off by a vehicle passing in the street, some 40-50 feet away, yet it doesn't detect my own vehicle driving into the garage 10 feet away, or me walking 5-6 feet in front of it - in the line of sight.  I've tried adjusting it every which way.  Even at it's shortest range, it will still pick up a street vehicle - not all the time, but I can't determine a pattern.  I spoke to tech support and apparently I'm doing everything correctly.  Maybe it will work better for you?\",\n",
       " 'I was super excited to get one of these, i had hoped to increase security at my home as well as eventually capture something funny haha. One thing I missed was that you cannot record ANYTHING without a subscription, it alerts for motion all the time without anything there and it really has terrible resolution for anything past a couple feet. You literally would not be able to get a license plate number if your life depended on it. I should have went with a different camera - the only good thing about this is that it stays charged on the door bell wires. UPDATE - The ring support team is great, they worked with me a lot on this, in the end I would say that it still is not the right fit for me, it is slow to connect to the live view and not clear enough but at least if you try it you have good costumer service to address your issues.',\n",
       " \"This Product was absolutely horrible.  I have used three of them.  One, which I will not discuss here, was a gift, that required an IT professional of about 12 years (SPRINT, ATT, etc) to fix along with at least two, hour-long + discussions with the Ring IT team, ONLY after my friend bought a brand new Galaxy phone (pretty sure it was the Galaxy 7) did they finally get the system to work.  I have years of experience using IT and web-based devices.  I run the website and email for three different companies.  I won't pretend that I am a genius, but I do know how to do a lot a research and how to 'get things to work'... I even run my own NAS and hosting service.  That said, I spent not hours, not days, but weeks trying to get this product to work.  I bought it for my 70+ old mother, who is having anxiety and security issues the older she gets.  I spent all of Christmas week, locked away in her computer office trying to get this to work.  I had to apologize that I couldn't get it to work, and took it home to my 'state-of-the-art' system which includes an ASUS5300 and current Modem that was rated best in class for 2016.  I tried a Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 computer, spent multiple hours with 3 different stages/levels of Ring customer support (which was a horrendous ordeal, where the 3 people just made me repeat--OVER AND OVER AGAIN--the same things I had already done, because I had already looked it up on their website.  This includes a Galaxy S-4 and a Galaxy S-5.  BTW, they don't tell you this, but you need a 2.4GHz wireless for it to work.  It won't work on a 5.0GHz wireless.  You also have to have a specific kind of security on your device and/or computer, which they also don't tell you.  Also, you have to disable all the things that allow your smartphone to get things like email and webservice... which I did for them, OVER and OVER again.  The jerk on customer support (that is not really fair of me... he was fairly nice, but was incredibly annoying and unhelpful... the first lady that spoke to me seemed to be high as a kite, however...just saying) Anyways, he demanded that I RENAME my entire network.  For those of you that don't know what this means, it means changing the core component that allows your entire Local Area Network/Internet connection to work with all your computers, printers and phones... any wireless device  After I did all of that, he then demanded that I change my network name again, because the name he saw on his 'database' was 'too long' of a name.  The list went on and on.  He asked me numerous times to give him access to our LAN/Network (that means he gets total access and 'sometimes' total control of our entire network... I totally refused each time... so should you unless you want every part of your electronic life to be hacked.  He even asked me to make the network available to everyone on the Internet so that he could 'take a peak'!!!  You have got to be kidding me, right?  Give the entire world access to my computer network and computer systems?!!)  He finally said, 'I have never seen this happen, we will send you a new device'.  The new device was no different than the old device... It failed to connect, even after I tried everything I did the first time as well as all the ridiculous things that the 'level-3' IT expert from Ring told me to do.  If it is so hard to make your device connect to an existing system that it takes--literally--weeks of working on it, how do you ever expect my aging mother to get it working effectively?  Ring is a lot of hype.  When it works, I heard it works well.  For me, they should--LITERALLY-Pay me for the amount of time I troubleshot their device for them, helping their IT teams to get it 'fixed' so they could 'record' the results.  I want you to understand that I am SCREAMING in my head right now.  And, as a matter of comparison, think of all the apps and programs that work--right now--with the phone and computer that you have.  Literally, kids in developing countries can get apps to work, with horrible internet connections, and old phones, yet RING can't seem to get their $hi! together with multiple phones, multiple systems, multiple internet speeds, to include brand-new, high-end, systems... And at the end, the guy threatened that he would charge me nearly double the price I paid, if he didn't get the return in a certain period of time... to make things even worse, he didn't send us a package to return it with (which he promised that he would do, just so that we wouldn't complain to Amazon... lesson-learned... if you can return something through Amazon, just do it, and let Amazon deal with these jerks).  Worse, and on top of that, he didn't even send me an address to send the return to!!!  I am not kidding!  I contacted them again and he sent another email, with the proper address and he had the nerve to ask how I liked my new system... despite the fact that we had just received it and hadn't even attempted to get it running yet!!!  Bottom line, I can't prove if I just had two defective devices.  I can't prove if their IT people were just not good.  What I can prove is that after all of this, if my experience, as well as the experience of their Level-3 IT team can't make it work, then my mother is never, NEVER going to make it work.  Overall, great concept (and I know it has made other peoples lives better) but I wanted to smash the RING device and their IT people to pieces.  Last Word:  Good luck finding the 'fine print' that shows the system requirements of these devices.  They are on the internet, but are scattered in different places (God Forbid they actually be on RING's website for everyone to find easily).  These requirement seem to be only located on various and 'hard to find' reviews like mine.  Good Luck... I hope your device works...I really do.  If not, you were warned...\",\n",
       " \"I've had my Ring Doorbell for nearly 2 years. Overall, it's a mediocre product. It's common for notifications to lag so badly that the person rining has come and gone before my apps start ringing. My son's in-home piano teacher has been half-way through a 30 minute lesson before my app decides to let me know he rang the doorbell. On top of that, I have it hardwired, but it still requires a charged battery to work, and when the weather gets too cold, the battery won't hold a charge (Ring suggested I upgrade to the Pro, which they say doesn't use a battery.)Another major annoyance is motion notifications. It's impossible to make them sensitive enough to pick up deleveries being left on my step, yet not notify me of every car that drives by, despite the road being 50 feet from the house. I've also begged Ring via social media for a temporary mute feature, but they seem uninterested in putting one in their app. When my kids play outside in the driveway, I really don't want motion notifications every 10 minutes, but also don't want to turn them off entirely and risk forgetting to turn them back on later.On the plus side, Ring has been very goid to me on the customer service side. They are very helpful when contacted. They even sent me a free replacement after my 1-year warranty had expired to try to fix the delayed notification issues. I highly appreciate their efforts to work with customers to resolve issues.In the end, I think this product is a neat novelty, but not reliable enough to depend on it for security. The most useful feature for me has been (when the battery isn't drained) checking the live-view to see if we have packages delivered, but any weather-resistant camera should be able to do the same thing.\",\n",
       " 'The idea of this doorbell is great.  The functionality is poor.It records as it should, that is good.  It alerts when you want it to.The problem though is it always records whenever it is activated, even if you are going in and out all day.  May not seem like much of a problem, but then you have to delete the recordings.  How hard can that be?  It takes a finger swipe to delete and then another finger touch to tell it that yes, after the finger swipe, I really want to delete this video.  If I go get the mail, a recording for going out the door, another for coming in the door.  And so on.  This gets annoying after a few days of doing this.  There is a scheduling set-up and you think you can set times to not record if you are going to be in and out, but that only disables the alert.  It still records.  I contacted Ring tech support, they say there is something in the works so you can do batch deletes, but they could not tell me how long that would take.If you go to work in the morning, come home in the evening and never go outside, maybe it will work for you.But if you have kids or are retired, you will quickly become annoyed at all the finger swipes you need to do to keep your device cleared.  I want something that works for me, not something that I have to work at to keep it cleared.',\n",
       " 'If you haven’t already purchased the Ring Doorbell then go ahead and do it now. I already had a complete security system install for my home before I purchase the Ring Doorbell unit and now it is my favorite part of my system. I’ve now purchased an additional unit that I installed by my side garage door.  We really love how the unit alerts us on our cell phones when every someone’s at the door and gives us the ability to speak with them. You never know now what kind of person may be coming to your door and this give you the opportunity to see and speak to them before you answer. It also records the person so you can look back later to see who it was if you’re not able to answer. This is also great if someone is up to no good because it works with motion and will record them. Again, I consider the 2 Ring units I have to be the most dependable and best part of my home security system. This is one of most innovated products available on the market today and it also very reasonably price.',\n",
       " \"Great video and motion detection.  I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the motion sensors not picking things up fast enough but I'm amazed at the quality of this and where we have gotten.  While it might be slightly delayed, it isn't that bad.  If anything, we get a lot of motion sensors because of our contractors working on the house.  But I can easily check to make sure it is someone who is supposed to be there.  I also find it humorous to talk to the family through the doorbell when I am traveling.  Quite funny to see them out there and then think about what the neighbors will say.  Anyway, if you are thinking of buying a video/mic doorbell and are okay with it not being 100% perfect because it isn't hard wired to an alarm system or even Ethernet cable, then this gadget will totally meet your needs.  The one caveat is that it is on Amazon for $180 and Costco has it for $189 but it includes the chime which usually sells here for another $20-30.\",\n",

I could have spent my money on a lot better.UPDATE 9/13/18 - Now you have to push the bell in the right spot it even make it ring outside, forget inside. Don't bother with this it's a waste of money.UPDATE -8/28/18 Live View works only if hard wired. This is not stated in the product description on Amazon. For me the Ring Doorbell is a waste of money.  Didn't detect mail delivery right next to doorbell. wanted this so I could see who was at the front door BEFORE I had to get up and go to the front of the house.If whoever is at the front door will wait 5 minutes, it will come up on video, otherwise I can't see in real time who is there.\",\n",
       " 'I installed two of these on my entry doors about a week before I had knee replacement surgery. I had to purchase a new interior doorbell and transformer for about $15 at Iowes to hook the ring doorbells into my existing doorbell wiring. I also purchased a Linksys Wi-Fi extender because one of my entry doors is some distance from my Wi-Fi router. I already had a Wink hub which work perfectly with the ring video doorbells, but I also tested the doorbells without the wink hub and got the same great results. I installed an android program called enhanced caller ID because it speaks notifications over my Bluetooth headset, thus when the ring doorbell motion sensor goes off or the doorbell is pushed, the message sent to my phone is read to me in my Bluetooth headset.I experienced a few glitches while trying to get everything working but the ring support service was exceptionally great every time I called. All of the problems I encountered were from something I was doing incorrectly or problems with other hardware or software other than the  ring doorbell.I answered my doorbell on three occasions from my hospital bed. Once for a postal delivery, once for a questionable fundraiser (which could have been a thief checking to see if anyone was home) and once from a person who was looking for one of my neighbors.After I returned home from the hospital I have had almost daily occasion to use the ring doorbell because I have visiting nurses and physical therapist, along with an occasional delivery. The doorbells have eliminated a great deal of disruption of my recovery which I otherwise would have suffered every time I would have had to go to the door unnecessarily.',\n",

Installed this Ring and connected to wifi but wifi signal was \"poor or ok\" at times when viewing the app.  Bought the \"ring chime pro\" thinking this would help being that it has a wifi extender built in.  Signal improved to \"Ok\" but was still at -61 in the app and video was very sketchy.  I have a Xfinity XB3 gateway with 150mbs plan and all other wifi connected devices in my home, indoors or outdoors work perfect with full strength signal.  Seems to be that the ring doorbell has a very weak wifi radio and does not do well for me to give this 5 stars.  I purchased a Netgear EX7000 ac1900 wifi extender and it helped a lot on the signal to the ring doorbell, returned the chime pro and got the regular chime for indoors.  Signal improved to \"good\" with the netgear extender at all times but still convinced that ring products have serious flaws on wifi signal.

If you try to mount it on a stucco wall it is impossible to get this mounting plate flat and tightened at the same time; this makes it difficult to clip on the ring unit and to make sure it is making good contact with the doorbell AC power.  I upgraded my doorbell transformer to a larger capacity to support my two doorbells and charging the RIng unit, and went through several iterations of attach/detach before I got it ringing my internal doorbell and showing as AC powered in the app.  There was also a software update that made it stop ringing my internal doorbell; I had to reset and reinitialize the Ring unit to get it working again.The Wifi functionality and App control works fine.

The images seem okay for its purpose, but as for security purposes, I think it loses a lot.If you have a long hallway to your front door say about 5 to 10 feet then this works great. My door, however, sits almost flush to the house so if someone came to steal my mail or steal this ring device, they could possibly do it so quickly that the ring would even turn on in time to catch the video. I can see how someone can literally walk up, put their finger on the lens and screw it off and take off with it without me seeing a single thing or for me to capture the criminal.There are good things though. When I am home I do feel safer that it is there, at least if I am home and someone tries to steal mail or the ring device I would have an opportunity to confront them if I am quick enough. Also as a glorified doorbell where I can see who is at my door when they use the ring function.As a doorbell it is great, as for a security cam I think it is terrible unless you have a few steps to get to your front door.I may look into a blink system.',\n",
       " \"I bought this as a doorbell, and for that it is awesome. Easy to install, had no issues. Works as advertised for me. I feel it is securely mounted and not too large, and people immediately recognize it as a doorbell and push the button. I can see them well and decide if I want to answer or not. Lots of complaints on here about the motion sensing, but for me that is an add on and not why I bought it. However, I think the motion sensing works good enough although I live on a VERY busy street with constant traffic going by all day and night. Some people assume this is a replacement for a security camera and judge it on that criteria, but that is not it's job. It's not going to catch every person entering your yard, but by the time they get on the porch motion sensing kicks in starts recording before they push the button. If they come onto the porch and do not push the button, it will usually get them, but not immediately. If the approach quickly and leave quickly, it may not get them at all. But that's OK, because IT'S NOT A SECURITY CAMERA. It is a very sophisticated doorbell, and it performs that function extremely well. If that's not good enough, for you, buy a security camera.  See my video of the UPS driver dropping off packages at my door. Motion sensing didn't get him approaching the door, but it kicked in before he rang the bell, which you can see him reach out and do in the video. If he had NOT rang the bell, the video would have been the same. Note that the sound blanks out by design right after he pushed the button, because the chime sound was playing.\",\n",

Literally like 1-2-3! Than when all was set and done, do the test by pushing the button, and it works just like that! I also bought a chime for the livingroom. Simple set up, plug it in, go to Ad Device, click, click, click and done. Do the test! Bang it works, love it. We left the doorbell in the livingroom and our 5yr old was the assistant to listen to us and ring the doorbell. We tried all of our phones and ipads, they all get a notification and we can all watch and talk with the Ring device at the same time. The 5yr old thought this was the coolest thing ever invented, since his iPad.Ok, installing it at the frontdoor... Took the box with me, took my existing doorbell off, disconnected two wires. Took the Ring backplate, matked four holes, drilled the holes with drill that came in the box, 1-2-3, easy screws in the plate, slide the Ring on it. Two screws underneath.. Done! Back in the housem kids rang the bell, all devices got allerts... I set the motion sensors a couple times (fine tuning), and I guess we are all good!Gosh, this thing is amazing! I can 't wait to communicate with friends, UPS people, track who swings by... Or even send strangers away. Even as I write it my motion sensor sends a message to my iPad. I click on it and immediately see the front side of our home.. I notice the wind blows, my palm tree swings a little because of the wind, but most importantly nobody there.. And that 's what I like! Sets my mind at easy... You never know who shows up at your house. I am sure this Ring will give us a lot more peace of mind, for sure when we are not home. I know I need to finetune the sensors again, set them less sensitive but that is cool in the app. Did I mention the app was easy peasy? Go buy it, I thought about it for a couple days but trust me, just buy it. We are not affiliated with Ring or the company behind it, just a GREAT product!\",\n",
       " 'After a couple of month of mediocre functionality, the doorbell only presented a black screen.  I tried every support option available including factory reset, but the app will loop back on the wifi settings with no option to move forward.  I contacted ring support went thru same steps and they said to bring it to retailer. Since I bought it at Amazon (Amazon owns Ring...right?!) it gives me no option to return (after 30 days). Ring support was very adamant to replace unit.  They made me stay on the phone with Level 2 (?) for about 30 +min support to justify the return/replace.  After almost an hour on the phone, they finally decided to replace it.  This is definitely  not the service quality I expect from an Amazon company. Unfortunately, ring is my only option for true wireless so Im stuck using them.',\n",
       " \"Man was I disappointed when i installed and tried this product for the following reasons* The video is only 720p*  When it does capture motion, the delay before it starts recording is like 5 seconds.  When the mailman delivers mail at my mailbox, the only thing you see is him leaving, not what he did while he was there.  even then, the first couple of seconds is the camera adjusting to the lighting, really crappy.*  You need to have exceptional WiFi or LTE to your phone or it takes forever once you receive a notice that someone is at your door for you to connect to the doorbell and either see the video or answer the doorbell.  I have an iPhone 7 and decent LTE and for me was an unacceptable delay in response.I currently have a 1080p security system installed at my home and i was just trying to enhance the security with audio at my front door and having the ability to upload to the cloud, but for me this was not worth $199.  If you have an old crappy security system that captures in 480 or you don't have anything, then maybe this has some value to you, but if you are use to a capable quality system this doorbell will be a let down\",\n",
       " \"Pros, it works great, love to be able to see who rings the doorbell, and if I chose to have motion sensor on that is great, you can have it on or off.Con. Unless you pay for the cloud service ($30.00) a year, you can not see anything that you do not answer, and nothing records for you. Why I say this is a con, is that it is $30/year per devise you own, not for the account. I have 2 so far, 1 door bell one for back yard motion, that is $60/year. I am just a regular home, not a lot of action, so I do not see that I could be using that much cloud space. I think that part is too expensive, but they have you over the barrel with that. Also, the security screws on bottom DO NOT tighten hardly at all, I have arthritis and didn't think I tightened one in that bad and I can not remove it, ended up having to snap it off. Customer service was no help, they gave me a couple tricks to try, like super gluing the screwdriver to the screw.. that was a joke, it's hanging up and even Gorrilla super glue didn't work, it is STUCK. Now It is broken and easily able to be stolen. I would of given it 5 stars if not for these two cons.\",\n",

However, the trip from the button on the device to the app on my phone being activated takes an appreciable time. Then I have to log into my phone. (Ring doesn't get to just ring it like a real phone call does. You get the notification, but - unless I missed something - you still have to enter your passcode, etc.) The software on the Ring.com website isn't awesome either. It's not hard to confuse it. (And if you try to build something more useful with IFTTT, there's not much in the way of an exposed interface to work with.)) So I can imagine this device being more useful than it is now.\",\n",

The instructions are straightforward and the Ring worked first time on my wireless network.A few gripes:1/ The Ring is large -- the form factor is bigger than you think. As a result it will NOT mount well on a standard brick mold door frame.  The predrilled holes are set apart too much. I had to create additional mount holes in the mounting plate to get this to work.2/ I live is a reasonably large house, with my router mounted centrally, about 20-25ft away from the Ring doorbell. This setup works, but the bandwidth is iffy. There's no easy way to get around this problem for most people -- the Ring is outside your home, and any wireless signal is going to have to pass through several layers of wood, wiring and who-knows-what.Overall, very happy.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this ring device last year and now forced to write review for this device based on the customer service team response.I used this as doorbell when I installed but earlier this year, I had issue with unauthorized person approaching my front door. When I checked the video, I couldn't makeout who approached as video recorded much later than actually person approached the door. the motion sensor setting was unable to pick up the motion on right time. I took up the issue with Ring Support team to ask the reason on why the motion trigger isn't capturing the video on right time.. Here are details from customer support team:1) Date 08/08/2019: I called technical team and they were confident that device is going to work and all I need is to make some adjustments. They send me some wedges to make it incline so that ring get right visibility.2) Date 09/07/2019: Once I received the wedges, I installed them by placing single wedge, later with dual wedge and subsequently with 3 wedges. I made adjustments to height of doorbell as well to make it less than 48in from ground. None of these adjustment worked. I worked with technical team and made the adjustment on software & hardware as proposed. by end of the call, technical team identified that the doorbell is not good to capture the motion and though my doorbell was outside warranty period, I was sent a replacement doorbell. (thanks to Technical Representative)3) Date: 09/24/2019:I received replacement doorbell in 2nd week of Sept, 2019 and I installed on front door. I observed that there is no improvement on motion detection with new doorbell. I called the tech representative and was told that this model of device wont work as it is dependent on environment. I immediately asked service rep to stop giving me that reason as Chicago weather is great from the period (August to September) I was raising the issue. If it cant work in that environment, Ring should either pull this product back from the market or issue refund to the customer whom ring failed to deliver the quality that they are committed to provide. I was given multiple reason but technical team is unable to answer pretty basic question to support the productPlease see the photo attached: I do have shrubs on side of the door but highlight path is 25feet long from the door. if anyone is approaching straight from that path, ring is only capturing video once the person is very close to door. (this has been tested on all 3 occasions when i called Ring Support team). Ring team is unable to explain why motion is not captured when someone is walking straight. they attributed to environment, thermal signature.. (throwing some technical acronym thinking the customers are fool). I work with these devices and my home is full with smart devices.. all those 3 days when i talked to sales/technical rep, the weather was great in Chicago and ring shouldn't attribute their device failure on environmental reasons.I won't recommend anyone to buy this device as this is not good quality product offered by Ring. This is substandard product and you will find much better options on amazon marketplace who can offer much better services..Ring should pull this product from marketplace as by releasing this product, they are compromising the security of families who are depending on such useless product.I bought annual membership from ring which I am going to discontinue as it doesnt offer any benefit to me.. why to pay for useless device if it doesn't serve the purpose..I hope this feedback will be helpful for buyers looking at this device online and thinking of buying something for their family security. Please buy wisely, after all its for your family's security..\",\n",
       " \"Motion detection is very iffy: sometimes sense motion 30 feet away even though sensitivity is set at 10 feet, and sometimes you can walk right up to the door and the sensor does not alert. The bell works fine, though.Update March 12,2016:After using Ring for two and a half month, I'm changing my rating from 3 stars to 1 star. Battery life is a major issue. So far, I've been having to charge it about every 4-6 weeks. Second, the third time I needed to charge the battery, the tool that was included to unscrew the unto broke off, so I can't even unscrew it to charge it. Third, still major issue with motion sensor; a lot of false alarms, draining the battery. And there's no option to turn off the motion sensor.Update: 11/2017I hired a handyman to drill a hole through the walls so the wire can be connected and the unit charged as often as I like without having to unscrew the unit. But there’s another problem I’ve notice over the past year of using it: WiFi connectivity drops very often, even though the router is less than ten feet away from the door.\",\n",
       " 'Easy to install, but I wish I had used my doorbell wiring. Removing the doorbell to recharge the battery is a pain. Also, it has lost connection to the internet about weekly which requires removing it to touch the orange reset button on the back of the doorbell. Lastly, picture quality is poor. I don’t even recognize people I know, so how good would it be for identifying strangers??',\n",
       " \"Works great!  Motion alerts and ringing doorbell alerts work great and camera image is very sharp and clear.  It's a little tricky setting up the motion detection zones and distance sensitivity, and there is a slight recording delay after motion is detected.  This resulted in recordings only showing the backs of someone walking away from my door...especially if they walk fast.  Also, the motion detection range does not seem to have much effect.  I had hoped this would help identify package thieves, but not if it only shows their backs?  I am still tinkering with the Motion Detection settings hoping to find the sweet spot, but I think the 2-3 second delay in starting the recording is the real problem.I finally gave up trying to get the motion detection set up so that it would record people approaching my door, and not their backs as they were leaving.  I called Ring Technical Support, and was pleasantly surprised as to how helpful they were.  I spoke with Patrick who was on the line with me for well over an hour running tests and finally concluded that I needed a Wedge Kit to aim my Ring Doorbell downward to prevent picking up motion from street traffic passing by my house.  He sent me a Wedge Kit and it arrived about 3 days later (no Charge !!)The Wedge Kit consisted of 3 angled mounting plates that adjust the angle upward or downward 5 degrees each.  I installed two Wedges and tested my Ring Doorbell and that appeared to solve the problem of picking up false motion alerts from street traffic, however the next morning I got a few more false alerts.  I installed the third Wedge and that fixed the false motion alerts but still detected motion of anyone spproaching my door within about 10-12 feet.My only complaint is that the Wedge Kit only comes in White and look cheap and clunky, but a quick shot of black paint fixed the color to match my black Ring Doorbell but still looks cheap and stupid.I am still wondering why the Ring Doorbell does not have some sort of software adjustment to frame the exact Motion Detection target area horizontally and vertically to easily exclude all areas where false alerts would be detected.  I have $20 security cameras that have this advanced technology, but the Ring Doorbell costing 5 - 7 times as much requires mechanical wedge spacers to aim the motion detection up and down??Ring's technical support was terrific and the wedges worked.  But even after painting them black  to mach my Ring Doorbell, they still look  cheap and clunky on an otherwise high-quality product.UPDATE:  About 2 weeks after installing wedges to aim the Ring doorbell camera downward, it started giving me false alerts every few minutes.  This started when the weather warmed up and appears to be triggered by the changing shadows from trees blowing in the wind or simply a cloud crossing in front of the sun??  Also, the motion detector does not record people coming to my door unless they ring the bell.  I have people deliver packages to my door and I never get an alert, but my $20 security camera picks them up immediately...without fail.  Without a more precise and reliable adjustments for the motion detector the Ring doorbell is worthless to me.  The Ring doorbell system may work well as a remote doorbell answering system, but the motion detection is worthless.UPDATE-2:  The Ring Doorbell Camera is worthless...there is a very long delay in detecting motion and recording.  All you get is peoples backs as they leave.  If people ring the bell, it takes so long to get the image up on your phone even when I am home, they have already left.  The TV commercials for Ring are total BS.  It will not alert you fast enough to detect people walking up to your door or to carry on a conversation with them.  All you will see is their backs walking away.  Someone could quickly walk up, take a small package off your porch and walk away.  Ring will probably detect them, but  the video will only show them walking away!\",\n",
       " \"On the positive side I received the Ring doorbell promptly and it was in good condition. According to my husband the Ring was relatively easy to install. The problem we have is with function. When we purchased it, we had no intention of subscribing to the cloud storage feature. We have no need to review all the people who have come to our door during the past week or month. If we are busy or outside, we simply would like to know in real time when someone's at the front door and distinguish between, for example, a neighbor or a package drop off. Without subscribing to the cloud service this is not possible. Here's why: When the app notifies you that someone is ringing the doorbell, it takes at least 15 to 20 seconds to get out your phone, activate the app and allow the image to be routed through the wireless connection. By this time whomever was at the door has left and all you see is an empty front porch. Hence the need for the cloud service to make the device fully functional. UNFORTUNATELY, by the end of our 30-day free cloud service and we figured all of this out our 30-day return window had closed, So we are stuck with an expensive doorbell when we already had a perfectly satisfactory doorbell.\",\n",

       " \"I had purchased this at the beginning of May and I've had about a month in a half to review this.  There must have been a design flaw in the first model I was sent as it would keep losing connectivity to my network or maybe it was just a bad unit.  After troubleshooting the issues with Ring, customer service replaced my unit with a newer unit.  Ever since I have hooked up the newer version (no contacts on the bottom half of the wall mount) we have not had any issues with alerts and recordings. Syncing the Ring with our home network was quick and painless as the program walks you through the setup. The pairing with the Ring app on our phones was super easy (iPhones and Android).  We all get alerted when someone comes and we can all view what is being recorded with sound in real time.  This is great when packages get dropped off at our house, a little less to worry about someone else walking up and helping themselves these days. Just like in the commercials, you can be just about anywhere and be able to talk to or just listen to what is being recorded in real time with your cell phone. You can log on with a computer but you can only review what has been recorded.  Ring currently offers a free 30 day trial of backup video with a subscription service after the trial.  Everything you need to install this unit is in the box other than a drill (if needed).  Setup instructions are straight forward and easy to understand. So far we really like having a fairly inexpensive security camera for the front of the house.The only complaints I have with the unit, and they are minor, is that most of the time someone approaches the front of our house, ring doesn't pick up right away, more so during the day.  We typically do not get video until they have passed the unit.  We have the range set for approximately 20-25ft from the unit (which is simple to adjust).  It will pick up cars in the street when my neighbors are coming/going, but does not always pick up someone walking up our driveway or on our walkway.  This could just be a heat signature issue because it is heat and movement activated.  The picture is washed out initially during the day, thanks to bright shiny So Cal days  but clears up nicely after a second to adjust.  The picture is good for night time video but don't expect too much detail since the unit uses a bluish-white light.  Other than those minor issues, the unit is a great deal and comes highly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"I live in the country! Now, finally I will know when someone is pulling up my driveway. The detected motion causes the chime unit to bark! (That's the sound I chose to use for motion.) It's OK that I hear barking when my husband walks or drives past the garage. That means I will also hear it when the UPS or FedEx truck comes calling... or anyone else. Our house is so well insulated that I don't hear vehicles approaching. And now I can hear it throughout the house if they ring the doorbell instead of just knocking on the door (which I can only hear if I am in the kitchen.) This is a big improvement. I like it!\",\n",
       " \"LImited value without their subscriber service. The doorbell feature works fine -- notification on the phone along with a picture of who's at the bell and the ability to communicate. The motion detector doesn't work at all without their monthly subscription service, as by the time the system opens up to show the view from the camera, the motion is gone and I get reminded I am not a subscriber so there's no recording. There's a free 30 day trial of that service, but when I first installed this unit, it did not work. The company responded quickly to a phone call for assistance by sending a replacement part, but by the time I received and installed it, the 30 day free trial period had ended.Good service, attractive unit, pretty good image, but without the ability to see what the motion detector is detecting, the value of this device as a security measure is quite seriously eroded. I will keep it because we work upstairs in our offices so the ability to hear and answer the doorbell makes a difference for us, but it was the additional security angle that tipped the scale in favor of this purchase, so I'm disappointed. If the system could work to snap a picture of the source of motion and store it internally in the phone instead of requiring a subscription recording, It would be a five star product.Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell in Polished Brass, Works with Alexa\",\n",
       " \"So first of all, I like the design of this doorbell. The button is obvious as is the camera. This way people who come to the door are aware they are being filmed and know how to ring the doorbell. I saw one product that had a glowing bell icon that you pressed. That's not as obvious as a physical button. I also like that it can be used either hardwired or on battery. It is hardwired on the door (so it actually rings the existing doorbell in the house and I don't have to charge it. However having the battery allowed me to take it off the wall and troubleshoot the device.The image quality is good. It's not 1080 so if you need that this might not be for you but faces are clearly identifiable and it works equally well at night. It's in the shade so obviously some of the background is washed out but even then I can make out cars on the street and in it's most sensitive motion sensing mode it cars as they drive by the house (no it's not set to that).I did have some issues initially getting it set up and support was great.

       " \"Purchased this Ring in 2018. Chose this model because of that fact that at that time, our home did not have a doorbell, so we were unable to hard wire it. We also figured that we didn't need anything too fancy, as our place was very small. A few months later we moved into a bigger home, with a doorbell and decided to hard wire this product. (Note, we never installed it in the first home since we knew we would be moving and were trying to avoid unnecessary damages to the property). Immediately after installation, we noticed that when reviewing video footage or a live view, there is an ear piercing 'wind' sound that is NON-STOP! You literally can't hear anything other than this sound, even if someone is speaking. We figured maybe it was installed incorrectly, so removed the entire camera and re-installed- nothing changed. The camera is enclosed in a doorway, so I'm certain there is no wind causing this sound, especially considering it happens every single time we view anything on this thing. We attempted to reach out to Ring, since by the time we installed it, our Amazon return window had closed, and they were unable to provide any assistance. I'm assuming there is a manufacturers warranty, but we weren't told anything about that. Super disappointing, as it would be nice to hear something other than this horrendous sound every time someone comes around our front door. Based on the fact that I have watched fellow Ring owners' videos via the app, it's safe to say, we received a faulty camera.I'll also point out that I'm aware that we purchased the 'cheapest Ring camera', but the video quality is mediocre, at best- I guess that's what you get with 720p. Someone can be standing directly in front of the camera and I wouldn't be able to pick them out of a line up.I am looking into purchasing a backyard floodlight camera, and considered Ring, but after this experience I don't think I can bring myself to spend $200+ on another camera, and risk the same issues.I appreciate the features of the camera and the Neighbors app, which is why I'm not giving one star. But I would certainly hope Ring is able to resolve this ridiculous issue with their cameras.\",\n",

Love to scare the heck of them when they can hear my voice but can't finger out where it is coming from...most just walk away!NEGATIVES:Doorbell low - one can't hear it. I don't like the fact that I have to purchase an extra device to get to hear the doorbell. My old manual mechanic doorbell, I could someone ringing while upstairs-not with this Ring without the enhancer.  I don't like the fact that this model is not electrical powered (AC) instead is powered by the battery. Meaning, You have to remove the device from the door with a special orange screw driver. Damn, and you know one has to search for that special screwdriver every month to remove the device and then charge it. Two, it takes a whole day to charge it. That's unacceptable if you are a traveler. Another negative, it has a delay in notification. For example, If someone rings the doorbell and walk away, by the time you get the notification, all you see is their back. Three, I don't like the fact that I have to pay for storage while other competitors coming into the market are not charging for storage.\",\n",
       " \"This may be okay if your home sits way back from a road.  Otherwise it's a huge annoyance.  There is a long delay before the device begins recording.  The tool to adjust detection area doesn't look like what's pictured here.  It's an arc that is only adjustable from the apex.  So if you try to reduce the motion area from your door to the street, (depth),  it also reduces the width.  Combine that with the delay and it make the motion detecting of this device awful.  You either get notified of nothing, or everything.  There is also a significant recording delay in the dark.  If anything happens at night, you won't see it unless it's right at your door.  If you just want to see who's ringing your doorbell, this is fine.  Otherwise it's a bust.\",\n",

If I had known this, I would have upgraded to the pro. I don't live across a street or have much movements from animals, so I have no problem with too much alerts. The battery life lasts for a very long time. I charged it once, and 3 weeks on and its still going. I placed mine on the door, and that was not the best idea, as I'm alerted every time I open my door. I did have a problem with the live view showing a black screen, but I spoke with custoner service and they sent me a replacement which works great. Installation was very easy, and instructions were simple to follow along. I would definitely recommend,but upgrade to the pro if you can.\",\n",

I really like the look of the unit, installation was simple, night vision was clear as well as daytime streams, the times it caught video from doorbell interactions the sound and image was clear and clean. On the other hand, I originally set the sensor to avoid the street, but it still picked up vehicle movement. I eventually set it to the setting closest to the unit and still, I pick up each and every car that goes by. It won’t however always pick up when someone (Amazon, USPS,et al) goes and drops something off on the porch. Lastly, it throws out more than negligent amounts of glitch recordings where the image is all black. I noticed it does this when the unit glows blue. That said, for me the cons considerably outweighed the pros. Sending it back.',\n",

Mine is really strong and set right up. Images are clear and the live stream is really nice. What I like is that you can set the motion zones for sensitivity. I even get notified when large trucks go by on the road almost 50 yards away from my door.You get notified on your phone of any motion alerts or rings on the doorbell. Allows me to link in and even talk to the person at the door if I want. My wife and son are home alone all day and I like being able to see who is coming to the door and talk to them, they do not know I am not there.Another neat thing is if you have an Amazon device like an Amazon Show, you can tell it to show you the front door and it will, so you can see who is at the front door before you even answer it! I have an Amazon Spot at my office and I can tell it to show me the front door anytime. It's a great security device.If you pay the monthly fee (only $3) it records and stores the motion alerts for playback later. This is handy if your worried about maybe having to have the videos for the police.As a 35+ year law enforcement officer, I think this is a great security device and also a nice touch for home safety and peace of mind.\",\n",
       " \"I have had this doorbell installed for just over 12 months.  The installation was quick and easy replacing a previously installed hard-wired doorbell.  Because this is hard-wired, I cannot speak to the actual length of time you could expect to get from the battery before needing to recharge.The motion sensor seems to work fairly well, but does seem to have a delay in recording.  This means that most of the time the person is already at the door before it starts recording, but only some of the times.  It is very reliable when the doorbell is pushed - it will begin recording immediately if it hasn't already detected the motion.Here is where this doorbell becomes absolutely useless.  It will only record for 20-30 seconds after detecting motion so while somebody is still standing at your door, the recording will end.  You have no idea what happens after it stops recording so if something happens you have no video evidence.  For me, this makes this an expensive novelty and not mush of a security device.I would recommend bypassing this video doorbell and researching others like the new Nest Hello.\",\n",

Easy to use and easy to set up. Yes there's a 20 second delay in getting alerts, but it I got used to it after about a week. Ring gives you a 30 day trial for their cloud server and after going through the trial, I currently pay $3 per month to use their server to save my videos and I don't mind it at all. Ring's app (that you need to download to view alerts) also tells you any crimes/burglaries/etc. that are happening in your area.

Very easy to set-up, but if you have vinyl siding and no good place to put this, your installation could get tricky. You could possibly stick shims underneath, maybe....or buy the Ring wedge kit. You can\\'t mount the Ring sideways, your videos would be sideways and it would look stupid anyhow. So I bought a vinyl siding mounting block at Menards, as they have colors other than white in stock. However, my siding is 1/2\" thick so I\\'ll have to get the Dremel out to shave off the entire perimeter of the mounting block, something I\\'m not in the mood for now. So for the time being, a window shutter isn\\'t far from the door and it had a flat surface large enough for the Ring.Battery life is better than expected, but I have live view disabled. I have motion and doorbell enabled. My Netgear router is at the far end of my condo, but the Ring has plenty of signal strength.I only wish it didn\\'t stick out like a sore thumb.Oh, and as far as the Neighborhoods app, which you don\\'t have to download to use the Ring, unlike another reviewer said when she gave this 1 star....your address remains anonymous. There\\'s not much action in the past 30 days from my Neighbor app because I haven\\'t seen many Ring doorbells installed in the 3 mile radius around my house.

The delay is so bad that I never see anyone at the door - they are LONG gone by the time the device app opens and I can see the front door!

I don't know what interference it picks up but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  When I am at my home, 40 miles a way, I have a very hard time checking in.  However, when I use the one for my home, I can see all around my house at any time, at work, from anywhere.  I have these cats that set off the motion detector all day long but it's funny to talk to them through the microphone and get them to run off because they don't have a clue where the voice is coming from.

No wires, no complicated programming, no blue iris / 3rd party app config, no annoying router complications, no separate HD to store videos. It also looks nice. If you try to go cheaper than this, you are in for a world of complicated mess. I've tried. People seem to complain about the motion sense delay. From my use I'd say it's 1-2 seconds. I don't use this as a front doorbell. I use it as a motion sensing camera for the side gate (where a criminal would actually try to enter). In that case, they have to walk all the way up my driveway while on camera, so 1-2 sec delay isn't as big of a deal. But if you put this in a narrow doorway and want to get a snapshot the instant someone appears before running off, it won't be perfect. Other things won't be great either. They all have delay. People complain ring can be stolen - yeah it's not hard to rip something off a wall. But it has already uploaded that video to the cloud, and ring guarantees the replacement if it is stolen, so... what's the problem? I wonder how long it will take before criminals realize stealing a ring didn't stop the video from being streamed to the cloud.

       " 'We didnt have a doorbell wired on our house so this was a nice option for me to avoid having to pay an electrician to come wire my house for a bell.  The product works pretty well and is innovative but I have a few issues with it.First is the delay from when it picks up motion to when you receive an alert on your phone is considerable.  Usually the mailman has already came and dropped the mail and is headed back to his mail truck by the time the Ring starts recording so all I see is his back.  Not a big deal if it\\'s just the mailman but if it\\'s a burglar or someone shady, not picking up their face doesnt really help at all.  Also, there is a considerable delay between the Ring recognizing motion, ending the recognition, and then being ready to recognize motion again.  For example, I walked up the the ring (set on 30ft motion detection) and it recognized me and sent an alert when i was 2 feet away.  I then walked away and headed another 20 yards down the street to get out of range, turned around and approached my door again.  The Ring did not recognize me at all and sent no alert.  I sat on the porch for a few minutes talking to Ring Customer Service and then repeated this exercise with them logged in so they could see the issue at hand.  They said I had a faulty unit and sent me a new one.  To their credit, I found their customer service technician to be helpful, thorough, and quick to try and solve my problem. I got the new unit but the issue persists.  Before thinking this is an issue with my internet/wifi, please know that the signal strength always reads as \"Very Good (RSSI-47)\" on the app diagnostics.Second issue is the speed of the app.  When I get an alert that there is motion or someone has rang my doorbell, I swipe into the app right away.  From there it can be anywhere from 5-15 seconds for the app to startup, load the video, buffer the video, and connect.  Sometimes it wont connect at all and just \"times out\".  While I will admit that sometimes I\\'m at work with a less-than-stellar wifi connection, many times my connection has been good and the delay is still significant.  I\\'ve tried keeping the app running on my phone to see if that would speed up the connection time but it really doesnt have much of an effect.Another issue with motion detection that I\\'ve had is the range.  Even when I set the range to 5 feet away, I still get notified when a car drives by even though my Ring is every bit of 45-60 feet from the street.  Not the biggest deal but it is annoying and definitely affects battery life.Which brings me to my last issue - battery life.  There is no way you\\'re getting 6-12 months on one charge as stated on their website.  I had my Ring for less than a month when it needed to be recharged but seeing that I didnt initially charge it (nothing in the box/setup said I had to and the battery level read 80%) I figured a full charge would tell the true story.  Well, I charged it about 10 days ago and it\\'s already down to 77%.  That\\'s 23% degradation in 10 days which means I\\'ll get about a month to a month-and-a-half usage out of it before I need to recharge again.  It\\'s easy to recharge but having to do so often is somewhat of a nuisance.  The one unknown factor here is my wife has her phone connected to get alerts when the Ring goes off and I\\'m not sure if she\\'s activating the video feed for each time she gets an alert and then letting it run.  I imagine that could drain the battery faster but I\\'d venture a guess she doesnt do that as she never even answers when the bell rings.Overall, I give the Ring 3 stars because it\\'s a nice tech piece to have, fills a void for homeowners who dont have a wired bell, and is somewhat useful security.  The issues above keep me from rating it higher.',\n",

Easy to install, all the parts you need are there, they work well and the customer service is the best I've ever talked to, any product, anywhere. Fun to sign in live and see the weather at my home and useful to find out that the renovators posted a huge sign on my lawn, before I even got home, so I could deal with it. I prefer the new webcam to the stick up cam in the  doorbell-shaped form factor--the swivel is better on the cam and it's shorter so I could place it under the eaves better. It feels sturdier. Wish they'd offered the silicone skin as an option. I added the solar panel to one of them, working fine but a more weather-proof housing for the back of the stick up cam would have been a boon. I covered it with tape to keep dust and ice off.  Bought a silicone skin from a 3rd party but it didn't arrive in time.  Overall, excellent product and excellent service.\",\n",

I immediately removed mine and will be sending back.Pros-super easy installation and app setup. Very nice looking also.

And don\\'t mistake, Good Signal Strength as the guild you should use when buying this. No you need all 3. And Ring knows this. But do you think they tell you about that before you buy? Nope.I had this for 3 weeks, and like many, I had slow video, no video just voice, no sound, no video, video turns on after the person has left, no notifications. You name it I had it. Everything looked great but then I ran a ping test from my local network to the Ring doorbell. It was replying so slow, I understood then what was wrong.I went out and bout a $14.00 2.4 range extender and just like that! Everything worked as advertise.I can see more people needed to add a range extender. I think I am normal and my router is not right next to the front door. And if you have metal near your doorbell there is no way around adding a range extender.I am giving this 2 stars because Ring could have done more to help identify the problem. But the idea they want to sell you is \"It just works!\" Yeah as long as your network is working it\\'s best. And most people have never tested the internet standing near there doorbell.And if you don\\'t need that Doorbell charm. Please don\\'t buy the Wifi- Extender ring sells.

I asked for a replacement and they sent it right away but nothing changed.

This happens every time.2.-  The gardener walking on the RIGHT SIDE of the video as it starts.

Support advised me that my door chime was unsupported, so I bought a new chime ($45) and it had the exact same problem (the chime works fine without Ring). The internal battery also stopped charging. I've had to disconnect the ring device and return it to Amazon. When it worked I really, really liked Ring. It had worked exactly as advertised and made working at home easier since I could see whether or not I really had to answer the door. Their support was very responsive but after several email exchanges the problem persisted and Ring became unusable for me. So I did return it and have asked for a replacement. Ring has one more chance, if the next one fails then I'm done with Ring. It was very easy to install and connect to my network. I noticed that a number of people had reported the same problems I experienced when I read through all the product reviews in Amazon. I pointed this out to Ring support and asked how they resolved the issues for the other users, I never got a response regarding what they determined from the issues reported by the other users.Update: Replacement Ring installed, so far working well (day 2). More updates to follow.Update #2: The second Ring worked for a few weeks, but then failed with the exact same problem as the first one, it started ringing the doorbell non-stop, but this time it started in the middle of the night. I noticed that the battery wasn't fully charged after I tore the device off the wall. Another reviewer noted that the device seems to be trickle charging the battery when hardwired and therefore the battery would deplete even when hardwired. I agree with this conclusion, being hardwired I shouldn't have seen the battery below full, but it was. I also notice this time, since this one lasted a bit longer, that I was getting many (and I do mean many) false alert of motion. I set the range to 5 feet but still got way to many false alerts, it seems like the device way picking up any trucks (delivery vans, garbage trucks...) that passed on the street, the street is about 25 feet away. I didn't bother contacting support since they didn't help last time. I really think they know what's wrong with these things but you can't get that information from them even when you ask how they solved the same problem reported by other users. I was the test case for a number of neighbors who were also interested in the device, I told them the problems, they can decide if they want to try it for themselves (I don't think any of them will).Thank goodness I bought this on Amazon and could return it easily, I didn't have to arrange the return via Ring support.\",\n",

       " \"I like the idea behind this tech.  It gives an extra layer of security, that I did not have before I installed this.  However, there are some problems with the hardware.  I can't see to get this device to detect someone when they are approaching the door.  Often its as they are walking off or long gone.  Sometimes when ringing the doorbell the alerts are immediate and others they don't even send a indication.  I even bought a extender for my home network, just for this device, and saw no change.But outside of those two problems, the video notifications are nice.  Just to have that security when you get those alerts is really cool.  If there was a way to calibrate it so that you'd get an alert as someone was walking to your door, before they ring the bell, or improving the notification when it was rung.  I'd raise up my score.Lastly, be mindful that this company records all of the video via the cloud.  Its $30 bucks a year for the service.  Now a lot of people don't like this and I can fully understand that.  There should be an option to record the video on your own to say a personal server or something.\",\n",

I had a previously wired doorbell, so it did require turning off the power to the area and wiring it in (this is not as intimidating as it sounds).After two weeks, the doorbell has worked exactly as described.  The only negatives I've noticed are:1. The camera activates a few seconds later than it should, so if the person isn't standing at the door for a second, it may not capture their face.2. Our front door directly faces the street (~40ft away), and the camera activates when large trucks go by (moving trucks, garbage trucks, etc.).  I've tried tweaking the depth detection settings (in the app), but I can't seem to find the right distance where it detects people early enough, but not large street traffic.

It's advertised to last up to a year, so I suppose conditions were heavy on the battery- have had workers at house, Halloween, family walking by etc. I don't mind the recharging as it's easy, but needs to be done overnight for the 5 or so hours and not missing alerts.I have not yet solved the motion issues where it senses garbage trucks every Friday out on the street after I set the motion zone setting to '6', which is a 5', 180 degree arc, and on 'light' in smart alerts for fewer alerts. The trucks are about 50' away. The timing of people approaching it seems off, where I get recordings some time after they've approached. Either this is  finding the right combination of sensitivity and zone, or it needs work.My last suggestion for them is to allow the app to open the webcam when selected. It would seem to be a simple addition to the package and one that users would like. I know I would!I still like my Ring but am taking back one star, giving it 4.\",\n",

After finally getting it all connected I was...disheartened to find the video quality looks worse than 480. Could not make out a lisence plate 6 feet from the doorbell. We have a tree in our front yard that creates a shadow, and the shadow triggers random motion alerts, even after dumbing down sensitivity. Video is delayed sometimes by as much as 10 seconds.

I love how I can also just look at live view whenever I want which gives me live feed in real time. All 5 of us are able to access the camera at once, which is very convenient and we feel much safer.Another great feature is the collaborative access to the neighborhood feed.

       " 'The physical installation of this product is a breeze and the documentation devotes too much time to that issue. The software for this product sucks. I don\\'t know who wrote it but it\\'s obvious that the app was not quality tested. There are too many decision points where the action required is described in a conflicting manner. For instance, the setup took me into the cloud purchase  where I was tricked into entering my credit card info twice, yet there was no way to back it out or continue the setup.I couldn\\'t even get the app to accept my address. The app asks for my home address, invokes a bot which shows my home address in a list, but when I\\'m forced to select from that list, the app inserts my neighbors address. I tried a dozen times and finally had to allow my neighbors address to be recorded. I hope I can amend this late.I did manage to get through the app and fix the credit card issue only to find out that the unit said my Wifi signal to the front door was weak. I was forced to buy a Wifi extender. Without the extender,  the door bell rang but I could not get a \\'live view\\' from the camera. Even with the extender (which is some 30 feet away) I still get poor signal quality notices from time to time.I purchased this product as a door bell with multiple chimes (since I have a 3 story hours). Being able to have a record of who came to the door is a nice feature. However, if you think you will be able to talk to someone who has rung your door bell or even approached your door, forget that idea. After the app notifies you because the infrared sensor has been tripped, it takes too long to invoke the camera so you can talk. The inherent latency is too great.Perhaps the \\'Pro\\' model is more responsive. I liked the \"Pro\\' model\\'s form factor but it has to be hardwired. If there was a battery powered version I would have upgraded.UPDATE: Today I noticed my battery level is 88%, it was 98% two days ago. At this rate the battery will need to be charged within 3 weeks. I now know why the Pro model is hardwired. Wifi and the camera are power hogs. To fullfill the marketing claims, this video doorbell needs a stable power source; it needs to be hardwired.My recommendation: get the Pro model, don\\'t screw bother with the battery powered cheaper model.',\n",

After about 2 minutes, I could view the video tape of the person who rang the doorbell.  By that time, the person had left the porch.  In theory, the concept is good; in reality, it doesn't work.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the application--no luck.  I called Customer Service and spent 1.5 hours on the phone troubleshooting the problem.

If your wall is hard stucco, be sure to use a hammer drill. Once drilled, mounting and snapping the device on is not as difficult as one reviewer says.2. Motion Sensor is terrible. The zone settings do not work. If you want alerts within 5 feet only, you'll still get alerts for cars/people from outside 20 feet. I've called support and tweaked the settings numerous times to no avail3. As others have pointed out, the device lags up to 5 seconds or more.

Also, I get over 50 notifications a day of movement that are all cars driving by my house however I can’t turn down the settings because it already doesn’t activate in time to catch an actual person. I’ve had several people stop by and leave something for me on my porch and the doorbell never even kick on. I got my doorbell Dec. 2015 and it's now it no longer rings my hardwired internal chime. That means that other than notifications to my home, nothing actually rings at my house. I've contacted their support 3 times now and it still hasn't been resolved. I was told that the resistor in my homes previously installed, hard wired chime went bad allowing for 22-23 volts rather than the normal 16. This then damaged the capacitor in the actual ring hardware. What's frustrating is, the actual chime still works fine, all I need to do is remove my hardwired Ring Video Doorbell and throw it in the trash, then install my old-school, battle proven, doorbell. I was told this happens A LOT but it's still been more than a week for them to even have their escalated support reach out to me. They need to update the firmware to allow for live view (coming in their Pro version however NOT HARD to add to existing models for loyal customers). All in all, I would not recommend this product and feel that they still have a lot of improving before it's actually more than just a fun tech gadget.UPDATE: After contacting their support, Ring sent us out a brand new doorbell as well as postage to send the defective unit back. I was unable to identify if there were any actual differences but I was happy to have a new one none the less. I just didn't want the 22-23 volts of my current system to fry this unit too. I'm happy to say that it's now been more than 6 months with the new doorbell and it's still working as expected. In addition, Ring.com has rolled out the live view mode for this model as well which is something I was disappointed it didn't have in the beginning.  My only issue now is that every time a car drives past my house it the inferred signature sets off the motion sensor. My house is 20 feet from the road and I have the front zones sensitivity turned to the lowest setting other than off, but there's not much else that can be done.All-in-all, I'm pleased and would now recommend this product and this company.\",\n",

It did not matter how I adjusted the settings, anything would set it off.  Fine.  Some users complained about this, so I went in with this in mind.  I would charge it more often.  No problem.  The next problem with this product was it would just intermittently stop working.  It would disconnect from the internet and not be able to reconnect without hours of dealing with tech support.  Nothing would notify me it had stopped working so I would have no idea.  I would miss packages I was waiting for bc the postman rang and I would not answer or delivery people or workers would show up.... I would have no idea it had randomly stopped working until someone would phone me to tell me they were there ringing the bell and I was not answering.  So, I am now 4 days (intermittently) on the phone with tech support.  I have a new device (which also would not connect easily to the internet) and I was on the phone again with tech support for over an hour.  Mind you, this is a doorbell.  Its a button you push to notify you someone is standing there.  This is not some high tech security system, IT'S A DOORBELL.  It does have features like a camera and motion detection but the main point of this device is to be a doorbell of which it failed miserably.  The motion sensor on my new device I am now playing with to see if I can have it just catch what is going on my property only....we will see.  The camera on the device that did not work and was replaced seemed to have better quality images than the one I have now.  Sigh.

The crappy part is that they force you to buy into a monthly subscription of around 30 bucks a year for the basic plan (that covers one device, so if you have two at your house it would be 60 a year) or you can buy their unlimited plan for 10 a month to have unlimited devices covered after a 30 day free trial if you want to have the ability to store activity. This means that in order to do anything other than live view your devices without any ability to store the information it records this thing is going to cost you another monthly subscription. Secondly, as other reviewers have mentioned, it will pick up cars driving by on the street even if you set the monitoring distance at the minimum distance. Ring definitely needs to work on their technology as far as motion sensing is concerned.

I use it on vacation to look out to the front yard to see what the grass looks like or if it snowed in the winter. I've had this unit about two years. I'm thinking about purchasing a Ring stick-up cam with the additional solar panel for the side of my house  to monitor the driveway .\",\n",
       " 'Installation/setup was very easy, easy to get the doorbell hooked onto our wifi network. One issue we had trouble with was that hidden SSID networks that are password protected did not work for us. Even supplying the right credentials, the doorbell couldn\\'t pick them up. Turn on broadcast SSID and it worked fine.While the doorbell itself had been excellent, and I feel my home and family are much safer while I\\'m away, I\\'ve yet to quite get the motion detection working right. When set too low, people have to be practically right in front of the door to activate the motion detection. Set it high enough to pick up individuals on their way up to the house and we get notifications every time a car drives by on the street in front of our home. We\\'ve settled on a middle range, but there are still quite a few \"false alarms.\" As such, we had to turn the \"smart alerts\" to its most frequent setting -- otherwise it picks up some false motion and doesn\\'t turn back on in time to pick up the motion of a person walking to the door.Anyway, I do appreciate the speed with which the door chime and iOS app alert you when there is motion. It\\'s almost instant. Many other home applications have quite a delay. Overall happy with the purchase.',\n",

       " \"This is a great idea but it is dependent on a lot of bandwidth on your wifi system. Installation steps are marvelously explained. I have pretty good basic internet service. I have essentially about 12MBPS down and .8 or so up. (Where I have it placed, it's well connected to the wifi system.) That's pretty typical for a lot of internet providers at the basic level. To be clear, my internet service works great. It's working great for everything I do, including if a couple people are streaming at the same time. Not a problem. But that .8 or so up speed is very typical for this type of service (DSL). But, likely related to this, my RING is unreliable, is slow to pop up on the phone, has questionable video quality and even more poor audio quality. The problem is that it does not even reliably function as a doorbell. It's one thing if the fancy features do not work well but another if it does not work as a basic doorbell. I get and believe in the security of having it be a video camera. I believe that this is a deterrent right off the bat for burglars who check first if someone is home. So, I would not entirely mind if it did only function as a basic doorbell while being convincing that it's doing a lot more. At any rate, I called technical support. They were terrific and responsive. But, at the end of the day, they said you really need 1.5 MBPS upload speed. I do not have that but will see about getting it. But, if that had been clearly advertised, I would not have purchased the thing at all. If you have really fast internet and great connectivity around your house, I can see this being pretty great. If you have so-so internet, I'd not bother until and if you have a way to address that. There are also various quirks about the APP but I've written enough for now. This is going to be a great product at some point but it's not quite there yet but might be if you have fast and great internet coverage and bandwidth.Their customer service (I have used the chat twice) is fantastic. It's a together company and the product can only get better. But if you have mediocre internet, think twice for now. But see update below for more about the doorbell service itself.Update: After a few days with this, I find that it works (the ringing part) about 6 out of 7 times, so fairly often, you can press the button and nothing at all happens. That  is, no ring anywhere. I have the external, in the house, ringer (you really need that unless you want your phone to be your only doorbell). I think RING would be smart to put into the doorbell device AND the external ringer a secondary circuit that works the same way the cheap wireless doorbells work so that if, for whatever reason, the wifi hiccups or is not the fastest, the RING Doorbell outside rings the in-home external ringer no matter what. If they can make 30 dollar doorbells do that perfectly (which is what we had), they could include that in this so that your doorbell works no matter if the signal makes it all the way to the wifi and to the external ringer by wifi. That would be cheap and smart. I would like my doorbell to work all the time even if RING does not always show me who is there.Update after a few weeks: This is working acceptably but not great. But I get notices and can see who is at the door when I'm away. But, the local ringer (the extra ring module you get to put in your house--if you purchase that--which enables those in the house not near a connected IOS device to hear the doorbell seems to work intermittently. Today, there was a workman at the door and my wife and too sons all were here and could have answered the door. I got the notice on my phone at work that there was someone at the door but I didn't answer it from phone because I knew all these people were at home. But, the external ringer didn't ring at all, it turns out, so none of them knew someone was at the door. When I got home I asked them all who came to the door and they said no one came to the door. I checked the doorbell and it worked fine (the main RING device outside) but it had lost it's connection to he wall ringer. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked fine. This gets to why I'm staying with the 1 star. This is a cool idea but it does not even work that reliably for me as a basic doorbell. Forget all the camera benefits and security benefits, if it's unreliable functioning as a basic doorbell when people are in the house, that is pretty bad. As I mentioned earlier, basic, cheap, wireless doorbells (of a sort we've used for years) work flawlessly. I really think the people at RING need to build that functionality into this RING device so that it always works at least as well as a basic, 34 dollar doorbell system that works wirelessly that you can buy at the hardware store. I think it would be impressive if it had both ways to make the external ringer work. The one (the old tech) would always work even if the ringer had lost connection for some reason with the internet. Now I feel like I need to test the doorbell every day or so to make sure it's ringing in the house. This has nothing to do with the video upload speed issue. My internet is working great. it's just not a super fast system (but it's numbers are better than the average in the US) and the signal strength is great all around the house and where these devices are. So, I like this but it's not ready for prime time as far as I'm concerned. I might be more satisfied with a regular doorbell again and a motion sensing security camera near the front door. Case in point, I've used camera's on IOS devices through ManyThing for a couple of years. They seem to always work.\",\n",
       " 'Only had this for a week, and with all the negative reviews I was compelled to write my own review.  First of all we had a break in a week ago, and I felt that we needed something like this fast, You get what you pay for, and this is not expensive in my view.  We also do not have high speed internet in our home, which is a bummer, but after tweaking the \"ring\" over the last week, I\\'m pretty confident it will capture anyone who is standing outside our door.  The first night we had it we had the sensitivity turned up all the way, plus we left our outside light on, with moths flying around, this triggered so many motions that I had to charge the battery the next day.  Battery life is short in colder climates, we had to charge it after only using it for two days, now it\\'s at  4 days since we totally charged the battery and it\\'s down to 42%, which means we\\'ll probably be charging it again this weekend.  I think now that we have it tuned in better, and the moths aren\\'t setting it off every two minutes this will slow some, but I\\'ll bet we will be charging it at least once per week during the cold weather.  It\\'s not exactly what we expected, but patients, and learning exactly how to use the sensitivity gives me peace of mind. Due to our slow speed internet we may not be able to use this reliably as a door bell, but as a motion detector with a video of whom ever is outside it is working good/not great, but good.  We\\'ll keep it. I read one review where a person owned a vacation home, in Florida, but lived in France.  They had purchased this for their home in Florida, and was not happy that they were not able to \"update\" it from afar, you have to be able',\n",
       " \"Update (original review posted below):Ring support reached out to me after reading my initial negative review.  They were able to resolve the problem by providing me with a Chime Pro, which provides a more stable WiFi connection to the doorbell.  This seems to have resolved my issues.  As such, I've changed my rating to 4 stars.  Still, it seems like this should not have been necessary to begin with, which is why I can't rate it with 5 stars.It seems the issue was with my mesh WiFi network.  The doorbell ignored the close access points, and tried to connect to more distant ones.  This caused connectivity issues and delays.  The Chime Pro acts as a WiFi extender, so the doorbell connects directly to it and does not have the issue of trying to identify the best access point.Original review:Not very reliable.  It's a fairly frequent occurrence that someone will ring the doorbell, but the notification will not come through on my phone/iPad for several minutes.  This means that the person is stranded outside my door for a long time, which frequently leads to the person leaving before I know they were there.This doorbell has one job--to notify me when someone is at the door--and it doesn't do it very well.  Very disappointed.\",\n",
       " 'The Ring doorbell works as advertised.  It will activate when it detects motion via infrared or when someone pushes the doorbell button.  Moving flags or shrubs will not activate it.  If you use it with the cloud option you can go back and visit the recording of activity via your PC, phone or tablet.  It will detect moving vehicles beyond 30 feet.  You can adjust the detection area to only in front of your door if you choose to.  I left the Smart Alert in Standard mode and it seemed to work fine.  I started out moving the motion range as far away as possible and then slowly brought it closer to the house until I stopped detecting vehicles at the street.  There can be delays with your device, depending on your WiFi connection.  Make sure you take your smart phone or tablet to your Ring unit location and perform a speed test.  You should have a minimum of 1 Mbps upload and download speed.  If you go to www.bandwidthplace.com , you can measure your speed.  My router is approximately 20 feet away from the Ring unit and travels through 3 walls.  The unit is hardwired and connected to my old chime.  It works well with a Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Samsung Galaxy tablet.  The setup was straight forward.  Just follow the on screen instructions and have your WiFi password handy.  The customer service is quite responsive via the ring.com website.  I used the chat option with great success.  I received an email from Ring stating that the on-demand capability is in the works and on the way!Updated 12/28/15.I started experienceing missed movement and doorbell activations. I rechecked my wifi signal at the Ring doorbell placement and determined I needed a wifi range extender. Once installed, the Ring doorbell is working fine again. Lesson learned is make sure you have a very strong wifi signal at your doorbell placement.',\n",
       " \"Awesome!  Love this!  Just wish the app was quicker to respond.  And the Live view.  Also wish the motion detection was better.  I got a lot of false positives of cars in street even though I had it turned down to like 10 feet.  Ive since disabled motion detection. .Sometimes If I don't have wifi when I'm not at home it refuses to connect at all for live view or if doorbell rings, esp over a mobile network or low bandwidth WiFi network.  . But that may be expected.  Those minor nuances aside, its a very neat product!  And I'm glad it came in Antique Bronze finish too bc it matches my door handles perfectly!  In fact, that's one reason I didn't get the Pro model (well that and Pro model being $80-100 more expensive too! Lol!)  Installing was also pretty easy. Took me less than an hour start to finish.

I love it, it’s so easy to set up and use... the only problem is that sometimes you’ll get a notification that “there’s motion at your front door” and when I pull up the app, there’s just a black screen with the ring logo on it. It happens way more often than not. I called support and they kept telling me to charge it, reset it, or get a WiFi extender... I’ve done all 3 now and my boyfriend is an engineer and he tried some different things as well, still having the same problem. This happened once at 3AM when we kept getting notifications that’s there was motion outside our front door, and it sucked because the camera had the “black blank screen of death” each time. Next morning noticed two cars out front were bashed in and mail stolen, we could have caught them if this device was working properly. I have the ring spotlight cam as well and I’ve never had this problem with that, infact if you don’t need a doorbell i totally recommend the Ring Spotlight Cam, it’s amazing and there’s an option for an alarm to sound and the lights on the spotlight are motion activated! But for the ring doorbell, they’ve got to fix these problems. For this much money, the camera should work properly.',\n",

Programming and synching with my cellphone was easy.  The Ring system detects motion from my house to across the street. Sensitivity can be adjusted easily.  I can answer my front door without opening the door, which is especially helpful at night.  Quality of audio and video are excellent.  I'm pleased with this system and feel more secure.

I have Xfinity and the router is less than 25 feet from the device. Battery time is sufficient when you can get it to work correctly. Another downfall is the device should come with the chime, that should not be separate, it's not a doorbell without it. That's a problem if you dont have your phone on you when someone comes to the door. It can get expensive if you purchase multiple cameras you have to pay for each device for monthly monitoring. Overall I think a better more cost effective solution can be found if you take the time to do the research and shop around.\",\n",
       " 'I ordered and received this video Ring doorbell system in December right before Christmas after seeing advertisements about them on Facebook. With how scary the world is today, I have decided since I am the only house on a dead end street, I don’t want to open my door to just anyone anymore. I am really enjoying having this and knowing when someone is at my door even when I am not home; however we could not get this to communicate with my existing doorbell chime, another one we bought and connected or even the RING chime which I ended up returning so it ONLY rings to my cell phone which is why I deducted a starIt does send a pleasant chime sound to my phone when there is motion in front of my house or on my porch which is awesome as I am the only house on my street. When someone rings the doorbell, it rings to my phone and I can pull up the video of them on my phone and speak with them, where ever I might be. I watch the mail person and UPS deliver packages while I am at work, I’ve seen the meter reader come read the meter, I’ve run kids off my porch wanting to use my shovel to break ice on a pond across the road from me to fish, all while I’ve been gone from home. It’s an amazing device and I wish we could have also gotten it to connect to door chimes in my home as well but it still works, just to my phone only. I HIGHLY recommend it.  There is one thing, after 30 days, you either have to commit to paying for cloud storage for your videos or you loose them all. It is $3/month or $30/year which is the more cost effective route to go, saves $6, I am all about saving every penny I can!',\n",
       " 'I bought and installed the Ring doorbell about two months ago and it’s been working great for me.  Even though I did have a minor mechanical problem with the installation,  I was able to find a simple solution to it, which I will detail in a bit.  I did buy and install a Net gear N300 Wi-Fi Range extender and placed it in the nearest outlet to the door bell(inside).  I had read several reviews hinting that a weak Wi-Fi connection could cause poor performance.Several reviewers complained about not being able to view the camera on demand and not being able to access it again if you missed a call.  But those issues are not a problem for me.  I have a few other cameras around the house which are better positioned for surveillance and I’ve been able to catch door rings about 90% of the time.  And when I miss a ring, I review the captured video to see who it was.  The real value of the Ring for me is that it alerts me loudly on my smartphone whenever someone is at my front door and gives me an opportunity to interact with the visitor immediately.  My other cameras just send me emails.The installation was a breeze, electrically.  But I had issues with the face plate because the Ring’s face plate is narrower than the face plate I took off from our stucco wall.  That left a small gap uncovered on either side of the Ring over the electrical box.  So I went to Lowes and found a face plate(see picture) which covered the electrical box entirely and I mounted the Ring on top of that face plate.  The result looks great(see pic)!I definitely recommend the Ring doorbell.  My wife was initially against purchasing it because of the price but now she’s showing it off to friends.  The irony.',\n",

Wish I could like it more but I would not recommend it for anyone that has a wired door bell.',\n",

Now to be honest this is best to be used where there is an existing wired doorbell so that it will always be powered and not have to be taken down to be charged, and will already have an interior chime. In that configuration there is nothing needed other than the initial $99 investment. Mount it, download the app, and connect to the internet and you're done. The feature I like even more than the doorbell function is the motion detection, so no matter if I am in my living room or across the country, if someone approaches my door my phone alerts me in real time and I can pull up the video and initiate two-way audio communication on the spot. That has to be just about the best $99 I ever spent.\",\n",

Eventually, it seemed we had solved the problem, but by the next day it was back to SQUARE ONE. So I returned the device, thinking it was defective, and ordered another. But the new one is exactly the same. Or worse. Motion is frequently not detected. When it is, there is no sound on my cell phone and the vibration notification is slow.

One caveat: the old doorbell ran on 18VAC so Im using that to power this device, am not sure if the performance is as good running on internal battery. That aside: My wife and I travel a lot and Ring does a great job of video monitoring the front of the house and answering the front door when someone pushes the button. The audio quality (send and receive) is good as is the video on my iPhone 6. I can interact with folks at the front door and they don\\'t know if Im home or remote. All video files can be downloaded from the internet, saved and/or emailed to the police department if someone shows up at the front door whose not supposed to be there. If you live in Texas and see them with a weapon in their hand its video evidence and you can dispatch of them in any manner you see fit (I like this part).  I have a friend who has 3 of them monitoring his entire property, he gets full coverage at any point of access. Onto the flaw: currently users have no way to delete individual insignificant activities so the list gets long pretty fast. Ring customer service says: \"all the old videos or recent activity will automatically be deleted after 6 months.\" Obviously the list can get pretty darn long.

I had to turn off the sensitivity because it kept picking up cars driving by my house.

In my opinion, this clearly points to a design flaw hence the later more expensive models which followed.  I specifically purchased this doorbell for the 180 degree view so I could see my front doorway and my driveway at the same time.  So, it serves it's purpose.

If you shrink the street motion down it automatically shrinks the walking down to nothing.  It picks up people on the sidewalk and street but not walking up to my door from my walkway. For example: my mailman walks up the walkway puts mail in box and it picks up the motion after he is away from door.  The sound is okay but not nearly as clear as it should be.

Sometimes it scares people when they all of a sudden realize their being watched and especially if they hear me talking to them. LOL - What I thought was interesting was that Ring will replace your camera if it gets stolen (imagine that). Regardless, the camera is quality built, does a good job at night (low light conditions).

This is with motion detection turned off.Even with Ring Chime, I can't always hear the doorbell.  People tell me they're pushing it (and I myself tried it and I had to push REALLY hard)sometimes if I want to see who's at the door, I can't because it loses wifi  even when nothing else in the house has.  Some people have said they had to push really hard on the button (I can attest to that myself)When I want to interact without opening the door, ring says its always having some issue.  Now, I've checked all my connections in the house, ring is always showing as active.  I was a network engineer in another life so I know its all connected correctly..

For example you see the recording of the mailman walking away after dropping off a package. If you want good clips before the motion starts get the Pro (the hardwired only model)The Ring app is awful when it comes to loading quickly. Most times it takes a full minute for the app to load fully so you can view the clips.I would change my rating to 4 stars due to the fact that the customer support was good to send me the Pro, no charge. However, I just can't support anyone getting the battery powered ones as they don't allow you to capture motion when it starts. So I'm going to leave it 3 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Works fine hardwired into my house. Only thing I don't like is that the app for android is very slow at loading video even on the same network. This makes this useless when someone has rang the doorbell and you want to see who it is before they walk off.\",\n",
       " \"As an engineer, I go nuts over techie toys like this but am not easily pleased by marketing hooplah and fancy packaging alone. So far, I'm pleased to report that the Ring doorbell's performance has exceeded my expectations of what a Smart doorbell should be. I'm satisfied with the lag (~1 to 4 secs in my testing) from pressing the doorbell to getting a phone notification message. Daytime/nighttime (has 2 IR emitters) video quality is better than expected. 720p resolution is very good. Viewing angle is very good. 2 way audio quality and volume is reasonable for most outdoor applications (making this in App adjustable would be great feature though!). It's faults are already well known: motion sensing feature not currently enabled, no ability to remotely activate the viewer in the current App, no settings to turn off the in-unit fake doorbell sound, no setting to temporarily disable interior doorbell sound (unlike Skybell).  I do have a high speed internet connection and strong Wifi coverage to support the HD quality video feed. Your results might differ if you don't have these by your front door location.I do hope the Ring App designers release an update soon to fix some of the limited capabilities, but I am quite satisfied with even the current functionality of the device. I've never used the Doorbot (the predecessor to Ring) and based on its horrid reviews I was scared to even give Ring a try. Well, I generally think this is a better looking and higher performing product than Skybell and I'm glad I took the gamble to try it out.3/11/15 Edit:  Motion Detection feature is now enabled and worked pretty reliably for the few days that I tested it. I disabled it again since I don't like generating an alert every time I enter and exit through the front door. I played a little bit with my wifi router placement and noticed that the Ring doorbell really needs a strong signal for reliable performance. When I moved my router further, my video recordings would get choppy and my notification lags would range from 2-10 seconds. Sometimes, it simply could not connect meaning you would get no video recordings and no notification of a visitor other than the hardwired existing doorbell chime. I contacted Ring support and they remotely decreased the resolution of the video to better cope with a low bandwidth/poor wifi situation but that didn't help enough. I would suggest that if you have performance issues with this doorbell that you increase your wifi signal by better router placement or install a signal extender and see if that corrects your problems. Overall, I'm still happy with this product.\",\n",

       " \"We bought the Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell after reading several reviews. We do not have wiring for a doorbell so were especially interested in something that would not require wiring.  Shortly after installing the doorbell, we traveled and were pleasantly surprised to be notified on our phones when the dog sitter arrived!  It has been installed for about 3 weeks and the battery shows at about 84% with reasonable activity.  We are not close to the street so it won't be set off by passing traffic which I heard does drain the battery.  Our router is upstairs and the connection is just fine.  We did have the sensor video free trial while we were away and it was nice to be able to view it afterwards, but for us I don't think it's necessary.We work at home and often can't get to the door immediately so the ability to communicate is a great feature. I would say that Ring Video Doorbell works as advertised and we're pleased with its performance.4/5/17 Update: Our Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell continues to perform well.  Although we did not opt for the video cloud feature, we have had the product in use since late October 2016 and today, when I checked the battery, there is still 53% charge left in it from our first use!  We don't have a lot of traffic or activity at the door, but enough motion for ins and outs that I thought we'd need to recharge by now.  I recommend having it, and we do intend to enable cloud video recording when we do any extended travel.  For $30 per year, you can't beat it.\",\n",

I tried 2G and 2G_ext. checked the RSSI speeds, up and down and every other thing that was suggested to me. I disabled and reinstalled the camera three times but nothing helped. I spent over four hours trying to get this thing to work properly. So...I gave up and returned it to Amazon. I have had a cheapy doorbell camera from China that, while not as classy as this Ring is, at least I got a good quality video from it before it went south.

I am very unhappy that Ring has to charge moneys so I can review the videos (Ring Protect Plan). To not have atleast videos from the last 24 hours for review is asinine and unfair. Not everyone is available 24-7 to answer the doorbell. I was considering purchasing another unit for the back Door but now this is totally useless to me.

We love this product it's like we are always home even when we are not :) really nice for the door to door sales men or unwanted visitors you can view who is there without them even knowing your watching. Also you can either hook it up to your current door bell hook up or you can add it on the side and if you don't have an electric hook up for it you can just charge it and hang it right up it lets you know the battery life right on your phone and we usually just take ours down once every two weeks and charge it up for a few hours it's has an awesome battery life you will only need to recharge if you don't have electric access on your porch.\",\n",

Connected the ring to the app. Then started the installation process I first took out my original doorbell looked at how the wires were. Then I cut off the power to my house from the breaker box. Then proceeded to put the panel on. Was very easy took on about maybe less than 10 minutes. Since I had previously connected the ring doorbell to the app all I had to do was snapping on once I had it installed. As you can see from the video it's good to go. Only reason I'm not given it a five star is that I tried it out a couple times were having people come up to my door and the video was kind of fuzzy when they were standing there so I'm not quite sure if that's my Wi-Fi or if it's the actual unit.

I spliced my wiring so that I could adjust it a bit from the original doorbell location while still completely covering the wiring.I did encounter some problems with the Live View feature giving me a black screen or not loading at all. I guess you could say I have a smart house with about 15 devises connected to the 2.4ghz signal ( garage doors, smart receptacles, thermostat, tv ) and 3 to my 5ghz. So when I added Ring it seemed to put a strain on my bandwidth. On a hunch, to fix the problem, I turned on my guest network feature, password protected it and it had the ring doorbell be the only device to connect to it. After it was established I hid it so that I couldn't connect any other devices to it, basically giving Ring it's on AP. Now Live View opens when prompted in about 5 seconds and I haven't had a black screen when I request the feed.\",\n",

If I set it so that every passing car didn't set it off, someone had to be standing close to the doorbell for it to sense motion.  Sometimes, packages were delivered without ever setting it off.  I lived with that for a year because when it did work, the image was very good.  However, I recently upgraded my wifi and needed to connect the Ring to the new service.  Unbelievably, you have to remove the doorbell to access a reset button on the back.  I have security cameras that don't require this.  That was annoying enough but one of the screws is stripped from installation.  I tried the original Ring provided tool.  Ordered a similar tool from Amazon.  Tried the rubber band trick.  NOTHING will remove this so I basically have a brick attached to my doorframe.  I am taking a hammer to it and going with a motion sensor camera.  By the way, if you google this issue, it appears to be fairly common.  I saw mention that Ring would send new screws but that's an empty offer if you can't get the old ones out.

The only free video is live video, which by the time you get the notification, open your phone, click the notification, and the app opens to show you video, the video is no longer available, and the person at your door has gone.

I now have to uninstall it with the special tool, charge it up for 2-3 hours, then go out and reinstall it weekly. Even when the battery is in its best condition you get maybe 4-5 weeks out of it on limited motion settings. The worst is I've had more than one package disappear from my front door and I always ended up with a nice video of the persons back as they walk away because the Ring doesn't start up quick enough to capture a face. That video is also terrible quality.I had the ring on my doorbell and moved it to my front gate as soon as the Nest Doorbell came out as I have Nest Outdoor cameras on the house and know how much better Nest is. The performance of the Nest is in a different hemisphere. If you have a wired doorbell move on from considering Ring and get the Nest. Picture quality in a different league, Person alerts not just motion alerts, no overwhelming amount of useless motion alerts that take 10 seconds to get launched in the app to see when a leaf blew in the wind, and best of all, the whole event is captured and a 24/7 history is saved, not just the back of someone walking away with your cat food from amazon.I also have a Ring 2 on my other gate, it's slightly better picture quality, and the battery lasts a bit longer but its still kind of a joke.

I have had this door bell for a couple months now, and it is perfect.The installation was simple, although I was installing the doorbell on vinyl siding, which they do not provide instructions for doing so. Due to the nature of the siding there are gaps around the doorbell, and the siding. I personally do not like that, so I will be remounting the doorbell by cutting away the siding and mount the doorbell to some blocks that I affix to the wall.The video quality is very good, although if you look at it with your phone in the portrait orientation it is very difficult to see (I have an iPhone 6+, so it isn't really a scree size issue). The image is very wide angle (fisheye), but that is what enables you to see ~ 180 degrees. I like this so much better than a peep hole, because I can talk with the person at the door.The audio quality is very good, I have had no issues hearing the person at the door, or them hearing me.One feature that I like is when the door bell senses motion, I can enable the video and audio, to see live what is going on, and talk with the person if applicable. I am still trying to figure out the motion detection feature of the doorbell. It seems very sensitive, and despite what the Ring video says, I have all sorts of things set off the motion sensor (garbage trucks, the mail truck, cars driving by, etc.). The sensitivity is adjustable, so I might just need to dial it down a bit. I have a longer driveway, so this really shouldn't be happening.The doorbell works best with the cloud backup of the videos. When you pay for this feature ($30 per year), you are able to see all of your past videos that the doorbell generated. The app just doesn't work as well without the subscription. For instance, my girlfriend (using android) could only interface with the Ring if someone rang the doorbell. Any motion sensor alerts, she could not view, although I could with my iPhone.The thing that I like best about Ring is that I know when my amazon packages have been delivered!\",\n",

Also my husband had to cut off edges of my rock and we still have a little grouting to do but It works great !!!!  I think the only difference in the 1080 and the 780 is the clarity of the motion.

So I installed my Ring above my doorbell because I still want to be able to use the motion-sensor feature to record activity outside of my door.  I get a lot of Amazon packages delivered to my doorstep and I like the idea of this doorbell being able to capture video of a potential package thief. The app is easy to use and so far this doorbell is working great.  I'm probably going to get the indoor chime to plug into an outlet just in case someone presses the Ring doorbell and I'm not near my phone to see the alert.  Great packaging and ease of installation makes this product an inexpensive way for someone to introduce greater security into their home.\",\n",
       " 'I normally don’t post reviews because I generally get decent product. Not so here.We don’t have the “premium” plan so all we use this for is the live view, or if someone’s at the door. One would think that because I’m not using the motion sensing or any recording that the battery would last longer than 2 weeks. Nope. The battery life is super poor. Maybe I have a bad battery, but we also have an Arlo that does record motion and uses motion sensing, and I recharge that every couple months.When we had the motion sensing during the free trial you can set the distance for when motion gets picked up, which in theory is cool. I set it for 6 feet (closest distance), and it picked up EVERY single car that drove by (30 ft away). If that actually worked the chance that we would have purchased the Ring protect plan would be highly likely.  Now I’m stuck with a device that I can’t really take advantage of it’s “good” features, and I’m constantly taking it on and off the wall outside to recharge it. It also doesn’t alert me when the battery is low, so people who stop by are the alert for the battery when it’s dead. Boooo.If I could return this I would, find another option.',\n",

Unless you want your phone to go off every few minutes, you'll be forced to turn off motion alerts. So you won't know when there is an actual threat to your home. 2)The doorbell constantly dies.

It rings when the button is pushed, and when that happens, we may be able to see the person. But just pulling up live view will get us a video picture only 1 in 10 times.  Otherwise it times out.  We don't pay for recording, so I think we are at the end of the line for feeds and thus we don't get them.Rings can take 30 seconds or longer to get to the phone.Our router is about 15' from the doorbell, so signal isn't an issue (says we are better than most others).  So there's something wrong with Ring's servers or the firmware or something, as this isn't working as we wanted.When Blink adds a doorbell, we will likely go there.We have had our Ring doorbell for a little over a month and I can say it works very well.  Reasonably easy to install. Easy to setup and works well.  We have our doorbell near our wireless router, so I'm sure that helps with a good connection. Video is clear and the app is solid.My only complaint is the monthly fee of $3 for recordings of all activity. If I could, I'd give it a 4.5 star due to this expense after purchase.Our purpose for Ring wasn't really security when we aren't home, so we can forego that extra expense.  It was nice to see who was at the door on the recordings, but really, we were looking for a way to remotely see who was ringing our doorbell in near real-time, and this works great for that purpose.\",\n",

Basically, I have to set it at the lowest sensitivity in order to stop picking up cars on the street, but that causes it to fail to pick up people walking up my walkway! Every day I get a video of my mailman walking away.  It doesn't trigger until after he's dropped off the mail.  Maybe the newer and more expensive model works better, but I'm not going to find out.

The motion sensitivity is very sensitive and I think we may have to turn it off. I would put this unit at the less utilized back door and order the newer model to use in the front as I have read it resolved some of the motion issues, but I have also read that it must be wired into your existing doorbell wiring which won't work for me since it's recessed and not forward facing.

It was certainly nice seeing all of the activity - and non-activity - in front of our house.  But within 24 hours, both of our phones were unable to send audio to the Ring from our phone, even when standing 10 feet away.  Wifi signal was strong.The other part was the delay in recording.  From what I read, the device uses an infrared detector to sense motion and somehow that causes a delay.  So most times, we see a person at our door step, not walking up, or our kids halfway through the door instead of approaching.  So we couldn't always know what the person was doing when we saw the video.  Both of these things are show-stoppers really and need to get fixed.\",\n",

When notified of a “motion” if you click the link on your phone to view it, the only way to do so is immediately go to “live” mode on the app. By the time you do that, it may be too late to interact with whoever might be there. We have an elevated porch and had to buy the wedge adapter to point the camera down otherwise every car that drove by set it off. The camera catches the neighborhood stray cat prowling around on our porch at night. When it’s windy, we can get false notifications. We can’t figure out how to deactivate. My husband wanted to surprise me with a gift and had to cover the lens with tape so I couldn’t see what he was bringing in. I was out of town and saw him put tape over it and immediately texted him asking what he was doing...so this is kind of a spy camera 😎 A few times I’ve gotten connection errors and I would like the app to be a bit quicker on response.

Make sure you play around with the settings to make it suit your environment and also make sure it is a solid WiFi connection. If you have the modem/router that was installed from your internet provider, chances are you don’t have a very good connection (especially if the equipment is hidden or a good distance from the doorbell).

I contacted Ring.com about the problems that I have experienced and they are sending a new doorbell to me. I must say that their customer service is very good but that is not the problem. The problem lies in the fact that the videos are first uploaded to the Ring cloud server and then downloaded back to your cell phone. This creates a lag time that is unacceptable to me. I often get a momentary error on my screen that says cloud server is unreachable. So you are at the mercy of the Ring cloud reliability. There is no way to direct connect to the camera without going through the cloud server. By the time I get an alert, if I get one at all, the person at the door is gone from camera view. The Ring support says this video lag is due to my internet speed and that may be true but since my DSL is average speed with 15mb download and 1mb upload, that means to me that this doorbell is going to be problematic for many people with DSL internet speeds.

Defeats the purpose. I think the manual says video can be effected below 20 degrees. We\\'ve had some coooold sub-zero winter days and only once did I notice the picture was not the best. But it was fine in much colder weather. Otherwise, the picture is clear and the intercom and live view features work well. I\\'ve talked to visitors at my front door from the comfort of my office miles away. I will say that it can be a pain to access in a hurry when your phone is locked. You have to log in. But it\\'s less effort than actually getting up and looking through the peep hole. We also have the chime accessory, which is nice.A note on motion detection. We have ours set up for just a five feet or so in front of our door. Our house is set back about 20 feet from the sidewalk and a good fifty feet from the curb. Even with this setting, we get alerts from passing cars. Not all passing cars and it never picks up people walking by on the sidewalk (both positives). It seems to pick up a weird combination of cars passing *and* airplanes overhead. I\\'m not sure how the motion sensor works, but it can\\'t be a coincidence that every video of a car passing also has a plane in the background. No biggie for us though. If your house it set closer to a busy sidewalk/street (or you live under a flight path), it\\'s something to consider. You can turn the motion notifications off though.',\n",

An ATV drove by my door TWICE within 5 minutes and it was so slow turning on you can hear it driving away but cant see a thing. Night vision can barely call itself that. You cam see thats about it. Impossible to get any detail of a face within 15 feet.  If i hadnt lost the box it came in i would ask for a refund and return it.',\n",
       " 'My daughter had a three camera system in Arizona.  Being in Texas and having brick walls we decided not to install that system. So we now have two Ring systems, one in each house. The ring system connects to my cell phone. Whenever somebody comes to the door we can tell who it is by the looking at the video provided by the camera on our phones. The only drawback I find is that whenever a car goes by the house, a motion alarm appear on the phone. Fortunately the software allows the alarms to be put on silent mode. In terms of setting up, the system is not as simple to connect as advertised. A problem or another came up during each installation.  However, they have competent phone help 24/7. Pertaining to setting up the unit, it you do not have brick siding it should be simple. But it you do, you better have a drill and a bit that can cut through brick as it will be necessary to drill the brick about 3/4 of an inch.',\n",

Getting the replacement doorbell was a 4 week effort involving multiple calls - while the replacement was supposedly sent on the first call, it took many subsequent calls checking on status to actually get the device out the door. Then followed stage 2 of this ongoing trial - there was a return label for the old unit that was supposed to have been included in the box. As of this date we are now almost a month in and after 3 subsequent calls I am still waiting for the label. At this stage I'm just waiting to be charged on the non-returned original and thus start stage 3 of this saga.Bottom line, Ring's customer support sucks. The unit itself is works ok there there is substantial lag between motion detection/doorbell and the subsequent notification on the phone. There is also a good deal of flare in the picture that takes several seconds to settle down before I can get a clear picture. In spite of these flaws the product still is an improvement over the traditional doorbell which is why it gets 3 stars - however just hope you never have to replace it under warranty.\",\n",

They asked me to re-charge and try again to monitor the drainage.  The second time around it lasted for about a month before the batteries were low again so I contacted support again.  I got a reply the next day that they would look into it and contact me the next day.  That was August 4th.  It has been more than two weeks and I have sent several reminder emails to them but am being ignored.  Is mine a faulty product or are all these bells this bad?Update: Ring contacted me the day after this review went on Amazon (I wonder why), and they replaced my device with another refurbished device. This one was worse and the battery died in 3 weeks without warning. I have contacted support again. Please stay tuned:-)',\n",

       " 'After a recent purchase of the Ring Video Doorbell, we found it to be just as advertised in terms of installation and operational ease.  Pricing from Amazon was well below the \"market\" and makes the Ring an even better value.We encountered only two concerns in installing or using the Ring.  First, installing the doorbell in brick (or masonry) requires a \"set\" of masonry drill bits, NOT JUST THE ONE PROVIDED IN THE KIT, as well as a \"masonry\" drill.  Since we had both this was not a problem for us, but a caution to others.  Secondly, we found the video to be much more grainy than the ads portray.  We have a robust wifi signal and still the images of people at our front door are not easily recognizable, even when parties known to us.  So if you want a clear picture of who you are talking to, this unit won\\'t do it.Even with those deficiencies, we still recommend the Ring Doorbell to those looking for an inexpensive way to monitor entryways.',\n",
       " 'I am giving this one star to prod the manufacturer into improving their customer service.I recently bought a Norton Core router. My family had to pair almost 30 devices to it. Sounds like a lot of work but it actually happened quickly and smoothly. The Ring Doorbell was the only device that was problematic. You have to unscrew it from the mount on the door frame in order to install it as a new device because it requires pushing the button on the back. Parenthetically, you also have to unscrew it to recharge it as the USB port is also on the back.The screws are not standard. The small head is in a star shape. I assume this makes it something of a key situation. The doorbell comes with a special screwdriver, the Ring tool, which serves as the key to remove the screws. It seems I misplaced the tool. I went on the Chat facility on the website. I typed my problem and an agent responded quickly. They needed a list of demographic information to order a replacement tool. I typed the information and found that my Send button had disappeared from the Chat. I was using the Edge browser which by now is standard. I tried again a multitude of ways to engage in a successful chat. I could only clear it and restart by shutting down the Ring website and logging in again. I played around with Chat for a very long time but always lost the Send button leaving an open session for the agent.Finally, I call the company. The customer service person was pleasant and seemed very helpful. However, she was not interested in the Chat problem. She again needed my demographic data. She said she was sending replacement screws as well as the tool as the old ones sometimes get stripped in removing the doorbell from the mount. It took the better part of 2 weeks to get the replacement parts.I went to remove the doorbell but the tool just spun around in the screw head. It appeared to small for the slot. Fortunately, my husband knew were our Tool was. It turned out the replacements Tool and screws I was sent were smaller than those for my doorbell. The screws did not strip and I was finally able to remove the doorbell, reprogram it, and remount it.Bottom line is that a simple change in network was a massive effort way beyond that for any of our other devices.',\n",

The camera needs to incorporate spot metering so the light is adjusted not to the background but the target.

But, keep reading...The 4 stars, there was no option for 4.75 stars-  It does have its minor downfalls: 1) there's enough lag between activation/recording that the trigger event is often missed. Ring blames that on internet connection, I'm not sure. 2) the video quality, at night, with auxiliary lighting, is pixilated.For my use, the Ring is a primarily a remote alerting doorbell. I have it backed up by an HD FLIR camera above the door, so those issues I mentioned are less significant.I'm glad I have it. I love the comms feature, I  love the remote alert whilst I'm away from the house. My house sitter has it on their phone, & that works as a safety net for both of us.

That means you\\'ll still get a \"motion at front door\", but are unable to view the video of it. Another words they hold YOUR videos for ransom if you don\\'t pay!Kind of renders the unit useless as a security device as it now can only be used as a over rated doorbell...',\n",
       " 'When I first set up my Ring device, I was frustrated at how poor or even non-functional the video was, despite plugging in a router extender less than 8 feet away from the front door!  I called Ring tech support, didn\\'t have to wait very long to reach a live, American tech support person, and was able to learn from her that my bandwidth was seriously lacking, even though my Verizon FIOS subscription boasts 75 mbps up AND download speeds.  You have to remember, that\\'s hard wired speed.  Wireless is a whole different ballgame.  My wireless signal was barely downloading or uploading at 2 or 3 mbps and my router extender was even worse, chugging along at 0.1 mbps to 1.2 mbps.  No WONDER!  I thanked the tech and realized I had another call I needed to make.Getting a hold of a live person at Verizon was more difficult, but they determined that my wifi security method ( the old WEP) and another setting in my router choosing compatibility mode over performance mode was seriously throttling my wireless speed.  That, and some of the other 21 wireless devices I have running.  Long story short, once I reconfigured my router, disconnected a couple of wireless devices that I\\'m not even using and set both the router and range extender to WPA2 encryption, upload and download speed on the wireless rose significantly  and the Ring device has been working pretty much flawlessly (see last paragraph), ever since and I am very pleased with it.  I DO have my range extender just about 8 feet away from the device and I cannot stress how important a strong wifi signal is.You can easily test your wireless signal strength by going on a wireless device connected to your wifi and going to a site like http://www.bandwidthplace.com.  I\\'m in California and the Ring tech suggested I connect to the Washington D.C. server to test my bandwidth availability.  I wound up going from .01 to 1 or 2 mbps from the original test to 10-15 mbps after the Verizon router tweaks and that\\'s more than enough to operate Ring correctly.As far as the whole installation kit goes - very impressive, except the little bubble level is rendered all but useless because the mounting plate is made of PVC or some other sort of plastic and the top surface of the plate itself is NOT perfectly straight all the way across.  Use a traditional level if you really want to make sure it\\'s being installed straight.My only other real gripe is being locked into having to subscribe to Ring\\'s \"Cloud\" in order to retrieve recorded footage of front door activity.  Not because I find it cost prohibitive, but because I find it an invasion of my privacy.  Ring wants to know my exact street address during setup (for reasons that are unclear) and I also fear their cloud being hacked to show someone our daily routine habits...  What time we go for a walk, for instance.  I would much prefer the option to store data on my own local computer or FTP server, as I do with the rest of my security cameras.I originally gave this product a four star rating due to the lack of the aforementioned local video storage capability, but changed it to a five based on the outstanding customer support that I have received from Ring both times I have called in.  I was noticing that when motion was detected, I\\'d receive an alert on my cell phone, but there would be no video, just a swirling blue circle outline in the middle.  However, video WAS being sent to the cloud for recording, because I could play back the event and see what took place after the fact.  I just wasn\\'t seeing it in real time.  I called Ring support for the second time this morning to troubleshoot this problem.  I got through within just a minute or two of hold time, clearly explained the trouble I was having to the tech, and she made some adjustments on her end that fixed the problem remotely.  Now, when motion is detected, I am notified within a second or two at most, with clear video kicking in no more than a second after that.  Now, the Ring works PERFECTLY and I am absolutely thrilled.',\n",

Despite continued above average Mbps, I purchased the extended.

       " 'The Ring Doorbell is a terrific example of something I didn\\'t know I needed until I saw it. When I got the doorbell, I took it out of the packaging, started charging it up, and got the rest of the contents out of the box.The instructions from the Ring website were incredibly easy to follow. I\\'m not a huge home improvements guy, but figured this would be pretty simple. It was easier than I even expected. I took my existing doorbell button off to expose the wires and connected them to the mounting bracket.One problem I encountered is that the doorbell itself is slightly larger than the mounting bracket. I didn\\'t realize this at the time of install and originally placed the bracket too close to the brick beside my mounting spot. This meant after I tried to put the doorbell on the bracket, I had to move it (1/2\" or less, but a nuisance).Once I had everything lined up, I connected the doorbell to my wifi and hung it on the bracket. All in all, not including charging time, this was a 5-10 minute install.The video quality is great and night mode works well. My only complaints:The video is generally over exposed. Our front door is inside a small alcove that is considerably darker than the rest of the yard, and there is no setting to adjust exposure. Because of this, when picking up motion it doesn\\'t really catch anything until the source of the motion is so close that you can miss a person\\'s face. For example, when the mail carrier drops off a package, I generally don\\'t see her face if she approaches the door quickly, sets the package down, and immediately turns, I can barely see who it is.If you need your exposure adjusted, call Ring and they can help to a degree. They genuinely seem to want to help, though the help is limited.Adjustable motion sensitivity is terrific and you\\'ll absolutely need to change yours when you first get it. Until you get it tweaked right, you may get phantom motion alerts for small animals, but in general these are easy to account for.That in mind, when someone rings the doorbell, I can see them very well in very high quality. This has helped us avoid solicitors more than once. A fun game to play with them: if you see the ringer is a solicitor, I like to answer the ring mumbling about Government spies, and how a clipboard isn\\'t a great disguise before asking what branch of the gov they\\'re with.I\\'d absolutely suggest buying one of these for a door with a small porch or no covering so there is consistent light from street to door. I\\'d still suggest it for someone in a case like mine but would advise setting your expectations correctly. You won\\'t see 30 feet to the road, but you\\'ll see who is at your door.',\n",

From the The company “Ring” is this new  WIFI enabled smart doorbell, its a gorgeous looking piece of tech, and comes in 4 colors(Satin Nickel, Venetian Bronze, Antique Brass, and Polished Brass) to match any style home, I chose the Antique Brass,  and I am loving it. The size of the device is not to big at all, it can easily fit in your hand. And installation is a no brainer even if your not a handy person, Ring includes everything you need to place this on any door, brick or concrete area.and they also include a charging cable, you may be thinking why a charging cable well that is because this is the world's first batter operated “smart doorbell” and I know you may be thinking well how often do i have to charge this thing, well the good answer is once every year, just one time every year that's what ring is saying, and I got to say i believe them, I've had my unit now for some weeks and it still says it is 100% on the ring app. also you can wire it up from your existing doorbell also and not use the battery.Installation was super easy and guided once you installed the “ring” app on your android or apple device.Now let's talk about what makes this doorbell so special. As you can tell by looking there are 2 things to take notice here, the camera lens and the button. The camera is an HD sensor with clear video and audio so you have no problem seeing what's going on at your door. there's also a 2 way mic on the device so you can talk to the person outside (think of an intercom) with a camera.the button when pressed gives an Immediate sound to the ring and also to your phone. On the phone you can see who's at your door and accept or deny the the alert. If you accept you can immediately start talking to the person outside while seeing them. This is a really great feature if you're not home as burglars usually ring the doorbell first and see if anyone is home,. Also you can set up alerts on your phone to activate as soon as the ring senses motion, and the great thing about it is you can adjust the sensitivity sensors from 3ft to 30 ft.also, when it senses motion it automatically starts recording only ( if you have the 30.00 annual cloud storage fee) if not it will just notify you, so I definitely think the fee is worth it due to the fact that you can check back on any video from the past 6 months.Overall I have to say for just the piece of mind of having a smart doorbell which also acts as a security cam makes the ring doorbell absolutely worth it and a welcomed extension to your home. with this device you're always home\",\n",
       " \"Well, I was really excited to get this item. I am a techno-geek and love stuff like this. The unit could be narrowed up to accommodate a smaller  door frame. I made it work used to screws, and some other hardware to shim and get it on the door, since it is working okay now, I will likely fill in the gaps with caulk and paint.My ring is right next to a wall, it would be nice to be able to block that out of night vision, because it bright. I cannot see anything in the yard, and would like the ability to block out that washed out brick wall beside it. I am know they can't make it fit every need, but certainly could improve the flexibility. I put it where my existing doorbell was and hard wired it, just not totally happy with it.\",\n",
       " \"We installed our Ring Doorbell approximately 3 weeks ago and I love it more and more every day!  Let me start out by saying that the unit itself  is very well made and it comes in a variety of finishes so there is something for everyone.  Installation was a breeze because EVERYTHING you will need to install your doorbell is included in the kit; a mounting plate, a concrete drill bit, a tiny level, and even a special screw driver.  The instruction booklet is clear and concise but I would recommend watching one of the installation videos before getting started.  Our Ring replaced an existing wired doorbell so it runs on electric current.  If you don't have electric the Ring has a battery that once charged will last for at least a year before it has to be charged again.  Our Ring was very SECURELY  installed on our brick home and it was up and ready to go in less than 20 minutes.  Because of the price, if you are worried about it being stolen don't be.  Once installed this thing is not going anywhere!  You would need to hit it with a hammer to steal it and the company's policy is if it is stolen they will replace it for free.After downloading the free app and logging into our Wi-Fi, which literally took less than 10 minutes, we were ready to start answering our Ring thru our phones.  The video quality is excellent and very clear, as is the sound quality.  We also utilize the motion feature which notifies you if someone is within the ranges you easily predetermine.  This another awesome security feature that lets you know if someone is lurking around your door but does not ring the bell.  We can see who is at our door and speak to them thru the Ring from inside our home, from our jobs, or from a thousand miles away on vacation.  We live in Chicago where crime is at an all time high.  The Ring has afforded us additional protection to go along with our home security system. Everyone that comes to our house now wants to get one for themselves, including our mailman! We are very, very happy with this purchase and are considering putting one on our back door too!  I truly cannot rave about this product enough.  Don't let the price scare you off, the Ring is worth every penny!\",\n",
       " \"I wish I could return it, but unfortunately, I kept this doorbell past the 30-day return period without thorough testing. I installed it using the hardwired option approximately 40 feet from my Verizon FIOs high-speed router. It wouldn't connect, so I had to spend money on a wi-fi extender which is installed about 4 feet away, just inside the front door. At that point, it did connect, and for the first 30 days (which was during the free trial period for the cloud recording option), it seemed to work fairly well. What I failed to test during that period was how well it functioned when you try to answer the bell or motion detection in real time. During the first 30 days, I made the mistake of mostly viewing the recorded ring or motion events after they occured. Since my 30-day cloud recording trial expired, I haven't been able to respond in real time to a single motion or ring event. Often, by the time the alert pops up on my iPhone 6s Plus, the event is long over. In the rare instance where it does alert me right away, the screen freezes and I'm not able to view any movement or speak to the person at the door.As I mentioned, I have Verizon FIOs high-speed internet service, and connection or speed problems for other devices in my home are virtually non-existent, so I'm confident these problems aren't related to the quality of my wi-fi signal or internet service.Keep in mind that if you're unable to view a ring or motion event in real time (which is basically 100% of the time in my case), after the 30-day trial, there's no way to view what you missed unless you subscribe to their cloud recording at $3 per month. The bottom line is, for me, this purchase has turned out to be a huge mistake, and I wouldn't recommend the Ring doorbell to anyone.\",\n",
       " \"Honest review of ring product. I've owned this item for about a month now and at first I was impressed but sad to say I'm glad I waited a month to review this product. First off the design has flaws, once mounted I found that attaching the ring doorbell to the bracket is difficult. I ended up having to tape it to the mounting bracket, I know that it's not just my ring since I purchased a second one for my moms house which also had the same design flaw. I also notice that at night the picture is horrible and grainy. One irritating design is charging the unit, there is no instruction on how to power off the unit while charging so the unit keeps activating and sends your phone into a frenzy. The main thing I am HIGHLY disappointed in is the motion detection has stopped functioning after ONE month, I went to charge the unit and now it's not working properly. For the price of this unit I think there's a few design flaws that they need to take care of. Also for the new ring stick cam you have to pay an additional fee for the recording ($30) for EACH unit, the battery lasts about 2 weeks, but I don't know what's going on, I charged the unit to 100 % and in less than 10 minutes battery percentage dropped to 95%. Buyer beware as nice as this product SOUNDS there are just too many flaws that I am unhappy with.\",\n",
       " 'I think the reviews and advertisements were pretty accurate, with the exception of a couple things.  First, the battery doesn\\'t seem to last as long as they say it does.  I have to charge it every other week.  The other thing is even on the highest sensitivity, there\\'s a little bit of a lag to activate the camera.  My front door is set back, also like a \"U\" and my door is at the bottom of the U and the walls extend outward.  My mailbox is on one of those doors.  By the time the camera picks up the motion and starts recording, the mail carrier has already walked up, opened the mailbox, dropped off the mail, and is walking away.  It works great for when people are at the door, but if someone walks up to the door and turns around quickly, all you\\'re going to get is their back as they walk away.',\n",
       " 'Wow, I still can’t believe how well this thing works. First, installation is as easy as they say: charged the battery before installation, removed the old wired doorbell, and installed the Ring doorbell (which slowly charges using the doorbell wiring, no need to remove the battery). Wifi setup also easy, and my router is close to the front door, so signal was good (app gives you signal info).All features are great: motion or ringing the doorbell sends quick alerts to our phones, and we can answer on our phone. Once, my kid can home from school, rang the bell, and my wife and I (both at work) answered from our phones, and we could hear each other and our kid, and had a 3-way conversation over the doorbell!Gotta buy their cloud service if you want to use it to keep clips, but that’s fine.Absolutely no complaints, works as advertised, and works great!',\n",
       " 'We got a package stolen so we decided to buy a Ring. It’s does the job and can’t complain but it sometimes over does it’s job and sometimes under does its job.The Ring will pick up NOTHING on days that are very sunny or windy. A ridiculous amount of notifications.A good number of times already, I’ve had packages be delivered but somehow motion detection doesn’t pick up the delivery person (if they don’t press the ring doorbell) The ring does pick it up 75% of the time.You also can’t really see faces that well. The quality is somewhat poor.Overall, it’s ok if you just want something to scare off people or wonder what people do in front of your house.',\n",
       " 'So I really like this overall. It has a good clear video, and the sound is decent too. It picks up a lot. However, I have it set to only trigger the camera if there is motion within 5 feet of the camera and yet it has been going off every single time a car drives past. You can see in my photo that the street is not even close to being 5 feet away. It’s more like 15-20 feet away. So it’s getting a bit frustrating. Yes, I could turn off the motion sensor but that’s the main reason I got it. I get a LOT of packages from amazon and I want to know when they arrive, since my mail man doesn’t ever ring my bell. I also want it just in case someone tries to steal my packages. Therefore I won’t be turning it off... I’ll just have to deal with the notification every 5 minutes. I’m hoping that they will somehow fix the sensitivity or add a feature that lets us select certain zones to ignore motion in like I have with my other security cameras.',\n",

       " 'i think this product is great. i wish i had put mine on usb charger before reading instructions further. it needs a good charge before it is wired to your door bell wiring. battery takes about 2 days to charge thru door bell wiring at least for me, so you could get low battery warnings until it is >30%. after it charges all the way there should be no more issues. you will need a membership for videos to be recorded, but it is at 3$ a mo, and comes with i think 15 to 20 days free to try before you even need to do that. also you will need to have a smart phone to use device conveniently. video seems to be ok quality. i also get notices even when traffic drives by my house. this is not much of an issue, and i know i could change the sensitivity settings. what i like most about this is i can track when usps or any service drops off packages and have a time stamp when it occurs. the 2 way intercom feature is good for if your not home you could talk to whoever is at door and see them using phone app. night vision works, but seems washed out, but you can still make out who is coming and going.',\n",
       " 'An item I WISH I could give good rating for.  Started out \"okay\" but got progressively worse.  Granted my DSL is not the fastest, so I didn\\'t expect completely smooth \"real-time\" viewing, but firmware updates for LiveView, motion detection, door bell notification just got worse and worse.  Now seeing black screen.  Scheduled appointment with tech support last week.  They cancelled 15 before start time.  Rescheduled for last Tuesday.  They cancelled.  Finally got someone, spent a hour or so rebooting, reconfiguring, at the end, worse than before.  Yesterday called and girl tried to walk me through \"fix\" but ended up crashing my firmware to previous version.  Spent an hour or so today just trying to get newest firmware back - no luck.  Now, nothing is working on it.  Oh.. when I received it, some pins on back were slightly bent, but was told, no big deal (and it did work for a while)  Great concept.  Terrible execution.  If you have fast connection should work better as far as recording, but device is suspect.  I think they sent me a returned item and now too late to return.  $200 paperweight.  Some might have good luck with it but it\\'s a roll of the dice.  I think they over sold the item and their bandwidth isn\\'t enough to support all the users.  Still waiting for call back from tier 2 support.Okay, edit to add a few things.  RING did finally contact me, several times, got firmware back and device working again.  An important point is that you do need a decent DSL/broadband speed.  ATT upgraded me from 1.5mbps to 3.0mbps last week.  Improved the video a lot.  Clearer, far less lag and appears to be more \"real-time\".  Also, they sent me a new RING device to resolve any possible issue with bent pins.  Again, it is a great concept, but there are still some bugs.  They added a feature called LiveView, where you can at anytime open the video to see what is outside your door and that will stay on for about 10 minutes if you desire.  HOWEVER, after installing the replacement unit and though I was upgraded to the latest version, the LiveView feature does not work.  Was told today that there is a known issue with some customers on this (obviously I am one of those)  Another bug is that when the motion detection goes off, the only alert I get is phone vibration.  No audio notification working and thus far the tech support has not be able to guide me to make this work.  Could be part of the issue that is affecting LiveView.  So, it does work for the most part, but I am frustrated that the LiveView isn\\'t working and I would really like to have an audio notification if there is motion detection.  What\\'s the point if it is later in the evening and I\\'m not carrying my phone and don\\'t notice the vibration.  It would be great to know that someone was hanging around my door.  Hopefully they can resolve that for me.  Saying all this, I still think it is a great concept, but you do need at least 3mbps and possibly may need to add a Wi-Fi extender for a better connection.  Also, RING needs to get the bugs worked out.  If I had LiveView working and an audio notification for motion detection I would give it 5 stars.  As it is, they have tried to help me and contact me about once a day trying to get it working so I bumped it up from 1 star to 3.  Again, it may be a roll of the dice for you, but if it works the way it is advertised, it is a nice item to have.',\n",

Pixel images. Does not record the entire detection of motion.During the day is hard to see the surroundings because the light and contrast are horrendous. At first I thought it was my WiFi signal but it turns out this product is just garbage. Battery quality is great. Installation was easy.

       " \"I tried another brand doorbell camera and the installation wasn't the easiest and could not get it to connect to my WiFi. I uninstalled it and bought the Ring doorbell. Once you install the app, it makes installing super easy and connected instantly to my server. The only complaint I have (small) is that the daytime video takes a good pic under my porch area, but in the sunny area it is bright white looking. Another thing is that there is sometimes a delay from when someone walks up, to when you get the notification. It's like you will see them walking away or nothing there at all. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend this doorbell to anyone wanting one with video capabilities.\",\n",
       " \"I have purchased a few door camera's like the RING but costing much less and they have ALL gone back to their vendors for a full refund. I did keep one though and will use it at another location of mine where it will serve a purpose. Now, let's get back to the RING. It took me about 1 1/2 hours to install but it was drilling holes for the plate that holds the RING, but had to also wire the two wires and a transistor to the RING plate and then go inside and check the chime I have and it worked just find. Should have done this to start with and not look for cheap. I definitely recommend this product to everyone. The picture is just fine and it alerts you on your cellphone and you can also install the RING APP on other cellphones and tablets it all works. LOVE IT. BUY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT.\",\n",
       " \"It's got 2 problems, one major one minor.  The killer is the lag time on communication.  My Ring is mounted on the garage facing the street, the front door is around the corner of the house.  I can't see the driveway from most of the house, so video is really useful.  I've got mine wired to a physical bell as well as receiving the ring on my phone.  The problem is that there's a lag before the Ring notifies my phone, then if I try to intercom to the Ring, it will take 30 seconds to connect.  If the app happens to be running on your phone, it's faster, but still slow.  I end up just walking to the door.  I ended up installing a dedicated video surveillance camera on the driveway as well, which has local record capabilities to an SD card accessible over my network, without paying a monthly fee.  The minor quibble is that in order to make a wifi connection requires removing the Ring to press the appropriate button.  So any network issues require a cumbersome (and in winter or rain, unpleasant) process.  It seems to me that if I'm hardwired for power and physical bell connection, the wifi pairing could be done from inside as well.  Fortunately it's not that often, but in 18 months of use, I've probably had to do it 4 times.  The monthly fee is appalling on general principle.  Local storage would be very easy to implement.  And there are other products that do so.\",\n",
       " \"Installed the Ring doorbell this week because maniacs stole my How To Train Your Dragon 3D BluRay from my new apartment. Thanks Obama. Anyway... the doorbell installation went pretty smooth. You might want to charge it right when you get it out of the box so it doesn't die on you when you are running the installation. I had trouble connecting to my 5G network (probably because of range issues) but it works great with my standard wifi setup. Probably positioned 30ft from my router on the other side of my front door. The picture quality is great on the recorded events... on the live view not so much though. That's to be expected though with compression for live viewing speed. The only two problems I have are that the recording lags about 3-4 seconds after a motion is detected... so when a criminal comes to my door looking for stuff it might not even capture their face. And depending on how stealthy and quick they are. Also they don't have an option to do live viewing whenever you want yet... supposedly this is going to be added to the software this month but we will see. Other than that I'd say this is a great product.\",\n",

This has helped them be able to view who is at the door and talk to them without having to get up. The Ring has been a game changer for them also with their grandchildren that are young.

The user guide does not mention this.2) You may need to turn off the cellphone data on your smartphone that you are using to configure the app. Ring and the app need to be on the same wifi network for the configuration to take place.It works like a charm, and is actually a product which you don't know you need until you start using it and start experiencing the convenience. Customer service team is responsive and knowledgable and provides the human touch (not scripted). The CEO is also highly responsive, he actually responds within seconds to any (relevant) email you send to him. The only downside I currently see in the app / product is integration with other home automation products. Some exists, but needs to be expanded considerably.\",\n",

It is easy to use, easy to install, and works seamlessly with the ring security system which we also bought and installed at the same time. The combination of these devices give you the information needed to make quick decisions about the security and safety of your home. If you are thinking about getting a security device, don't go cheap, we did and it was terrible. On the other hand, don't go with a $40+  through a monitoring company that gives you less than what ring does. These devices truly help families feel more secure when in or out of their homes. I can know where my family is at and make sure that there is no one trying to harm them. Bonus, if you have kids that stay at home or pets in the house, the ring security comes with a Fire/CO2 alarm listener that alerts you if your alarm is going off. This would then allow you to move into emergency action if needed.\",\n",

They have many nice cases, however, they are not interchangeable so you will need to replace the entire system if you wanted a new color. Overall I do really like this and it is very handy to have the notification if someone walks near my house or rings the bell and be able to speak to them. It also is nice when you are away you can see when someone checks on your house and double check if the door had been locked.Design: 3/5Connection: 3.5/5Software: 4/5Convenience: 5/5Inter-connectivity (non-Ring Devices): 0/5Reliability: 4/5Camera Quality: 3.5/5Response time: 3.5/5Overall: 4/5',\n",

Wish I had known this before mounting the doorbell since the mounting holes are different for the mounting wedge kit. The instructions should guide one to hold the camera in place and record video prior to mounting to be sure the view is what you need.Notifications work well on the phone. I added a ring chime as well since I don't have my phone on me around the house.

       " 'This thing is awesome! Works just as described and is extremely configurable. As for the wifi connectivity, I\\'m writing this review in the Cayman Islands and my Ring doorbell is notifying me of activity at my front door. Incredible! Glad I bought it.<><><><><>< UPDATE 20 Dec 2015 ><><><><><>I\\'ve had the Ring doorbell now for a few months and still love it. It\\'s really been helpful this Christmas season with being notified about package deliveries while away from the house. But this update is about Ring\\'s customer service. In November, the WiFi notifications stopped all of a sudden. It\\'s easy to know when it happens because the familiar Ring sound on your iPhone/iPad doesn\\'t happen when the house doorbell rings. I called Ring\\'s customer service and asked them what to do. The phone representative performed a couple of diagnostic tests on the doorbell (with me pushing the button at appropriate times), then had me do a hard reset of the device. When that didn\\'t clear up the issue, they shipped a brand new unit to me the next day. I did a simple swap of the old device for the new device and returned the old device to them post-paid. Didn\\'t cost me a cent and the new device has been working perfectly ever since.Their customer service was quick (no waiting time on the phone and no extensive \"try this\" or \"try that\" experiments), knowledgable, and courteous. Their rep knew exactly what to do to test it and didn\\'t bat an eyelash sending out a new one.I still love this device for what it does for me, and now I know their customer service is top notch.',\n",

You  can do  live \"calls\", where they ring the bell.  \"Live View\" also works but will destroy your battery life.  The motion detection is garbage.  It will go off for way too many false positives, no matter how you set it up.  The most aggravating thing is that you own the device, but you can\\'t record anything with it without buying their service.  The might was well lease it to you...Do yourself a favor: buy something else.',\n",
       " 'This Ring doorbell is disappointing. When someone rings the doorbell you are supposed to be able to talk to that person immediately. Our experience has repeatedly been that by the time we get the alert that someone is at the door, it’s too late. The person is long gone. This experience is true no matter whether we are home or not. It could be related to a weak WiFi device built into the ring doorbell itself because all of our WiFi devices get a strong signal from our router every where, inside and outside of our house. There is no reason for this doorbell to fail other than the doorbell itself having substandard manufacturing. If you pay for the subscription to have all your videos stored on their cloud, you can then watch what was recorded that you were supposed to be able to see live. Save your money and avoid frustration and just buy a Blink camera. You don’t have to buy a subscription to see recordings with Blink. It is a motion detecting camera. You can’t talk to anyone through it, yet, but at least you get alerts immediately and can see what’s going on while it’s happening.',\n",

There was a long lag,maybe 5-6 seconds between hitting the doorbell and the phone notification.Then when attempting to use the video the lag time was even slower or would freeze the device. I tried standing directly over my router with both my phone and the Ring and there was no change. To be fair, I have not tried customer service for troubleshooting but my husband and I both played with it and are pretty savvy. Neither of us had decent results. Bonus, I just read the fine print. 30 day return and I am at day 34. Ha!UPDATE 5/19/17. I was contacted by customer service after I wrote this review. They called my house and emailed a few times before I gave them a chance and spoke with them. I was convinced we had tried everything and they couldn\\'t help me. After speaking with \"Orlando\" and following his instructions to test a few things he deemed my internet too slow. He even suggested I contact my provider to see if I can get faster internet or check that I am not paying for faster internet then I am getting. Within 30 minutes he had refunded my money. The whole thing. Shipping fees and all. AMAZING customer service. Thank you , Orlando! I changed my review from a 1 to a 3.

Sometimes it works perfectly, other times it fails to recognise/ alert if an approach. Example: it alerted of someone running away from the front door but nothing about how they got there. I have it on the most sensitive settings.Alexa - I linked mine to Alexa - to test it. Mistake for me as it over-rides all volume controls and attempts to silence it. If you work shifts/nights think again as I had to unplug Alexa to stop the alerts.Overall - it’s good. The inconsistency concerns me and I hear that is a concern for other owners too.',\n",
       " 'While this doorbell is a great idea it\\'s not worth the money and probably worse than a regular doorbell. I\\'ve had it about 8 months and only had it perform as advertised once.First, it\\'s slow to ring. I can literally hear people at the door, walk downstairs, and answer the door before my phone actually tells me there is someone there. I expect it\\'s reasonable for someone to ring my doorbell, wait, and decide to leave before I ever knew they were there. And if I don\\'t pay for additional cloud video storage (which I think is price gouging) I might not even be able to find out who it was.Second, for some reason the doorbell uses a metric ton of bandwidth to broadcast. If the doorbell rings every other device in the house lags for about a minute. This is also true with the motion detection which is rather spotty (you can sneak past it unnoticed if you walk reasonably slowly). This makes everything from Netflix to online gaming unbearable if you live in a busy neighborhood. And the motion detection thing would probably be really scary if I was trying to use it for security.Third, the device lacks any integration. It would make great sense to link the doorbell to the lights. If you really wanted to be cool you could link to smart TV\\'s, game consoles, or Amazon Echo. None of that exists.Again, it\\'s a killer idea. It just fails to function properly in any sense and is less useful than a \"dumb\" doorbell.I gave it two stars because at least the hardware is sturdy (tough plastic) and physically it is well designed. Everything else... not so much.',\n",

Being 720p does present only a fair quality picture. You can see people up close but past about 15 feet it’s a blur. So you can forget figuring out what car is parked in front of your house or people passing by on sidewalk. Will watch for the 1080p to get more affordable and upgrade soon. I should say I have no trouble with almost instantaneous alerts for motion and ring. I have very good broadband high speed internet so I’m sure that’s why I have no problems with delays mentioned in other reviews.',\n",
       " \"I have several of these units. My experience is variable - one works pretty well, one works a little less well and one is troublesome. Challenges:1) Live view is not reliable - Sometimes all you get from live view is a black screen. On one unit it's more than 50% of the time. Another I might actually get to see live 80% of the time.2) One unit does not recognize that it is hard wired for power - I have three transformers powering the devices. Two devices work fine, and show that they are powered by transformer. The third does not. I suspect an issue with the mounting plate, but the thing is I think it does charge occasionally, as the battery lasts really long - longer than if it wasn't connected to power.3) Sometimes one of the three will record a black screen for detected motion.Overall I think the devices are still a little half baked.\",\n",
       " \"In fairness, here is an update to my original review below: we had to order a new cable modem recently (thanks to badgering from my cable company about the old one being too slow and not supported anymore), and the faster speed of the modem seems to have solved the battery and lost connection issues.  I just wish Ring had suggested this back in the fall when we were trying to figure out what was wrong.  We might have been able to save the hassle of exchanging for a new one, if we had known it was the modem speed hindering us.  I also fault Ring for not providing more specifics about what speeds of modems are acceptable.  Our old one fell within their specs, so we didn't think that could be the problem.After I posted my original review, Ring customer support was very proactive about trying to help me solve my issues (as evidenced by the company's responses to the review).  Through email, Ring put me in touch with a customer service rep who set up a time to call me.  Unfortunately, the call was not at the scheduled time (the first time it was 15 min after the scheduled appointment, the second time it was 1 hour (!!!) after the set time).  After the second time, I gave up with this method, since it didn't appear that my time was valued by the company.  I appreciated their efforts, but I decided I would just try to solve the other issue (delayed motion detection) by myself...or as a last resort, I could call them instead.Original review (2 stars): I bought the Ring doorbell, because we don't have an easy way to see people at our door (no side window or peephole).  However, I am strongly tempted to go back to our regular doorbell after all of the problems we have had with this.  Just like other reviewers, we have the same problem that motion only engages once the person is walking away.  Obviously, this is useless if we want to see the face of the person.  There is also a seemingly long delay between the bell being pushed and the sound coming through on the phone or plug-in bell.  The other two major problems are the battery life and loss of wifi connectivity.  The wifi connection always reads as very good, but connection is lost at least once a week, meaning the doorbell has to be taken down and re-linked to the wifi.  We often don't realize this until days have gone by with no motion or someone we are expecting tries the doorbell and has to text instead to let us know he/she is outside.  Battery life is my biggest complaint.  The Ring doorbell is marketed as having a 6-month battery life.  Professional reviews said it would be more like 2 months, but we can barely get 2 weeks.  We have limited motion/use of the doorbell, meaning we don't have a lot of activity at our door that would drain the battery.  Motion settings are low too, reducing the drain.  The first Ring we bought barely held a charge for a week.  Ring exchanged it with another, after reviewing our records and agreeing we likely had a faulty battery.  However, the second doorbell we received is no better, and it can hold a charge for maybe 8-10 days.  But, with the constant loss of connectivity and battery drain, we are messing with the doorbell at least once a week.  I don't recommend spending the money on this product.\",\n",

It turned out that I had a faulty device Jason shipped a new one out to me pronto. The new one works great! He even checked in with me to see how it was working.

The camera images not too impressive either, although you do get to see who is at the door, as long as they are not covering their face. Motion sensors work quite well, but there is a delay of a few seconds until you get a message on your phone. The app could easily be better designed. Like all smart gadgets, it can be thrown offline by a power surge or outage, then you have to reset. My biggest objection is being force to pay for a subscription, if you want to save your videos, with no alternatives offered. Fun, a little overpriced toy.\",\n",

I also had problems with the software and Savin of videos.  Among other problems I can’t remember.

I felt like there had to be more to it but I was wrong...it really was that easy.The one recommendation that I would make  for a prospective Ring owner is to make sure that you have adequate wifi bandwidth and connectivity in the place where you intend to put the ring.  Around the time I installed the Ring I also installed a couple wifi cameras (a different brand) and I found that my wifi signal wasn't strong enough to support all of my wifi devices.  This has nothing to do with the Ring, but it's something to think about when you're adding a video based wifi device.UPDATE:So I've had the ring for a few months now.  It still works really well.  I called customer support when I had an issue with the Chime (which was my fault). Their customer support was top notch and definitely located in either the United States or Canada.  In addition to being super responsive, knowledgeable and courteous on the phone they had fantastic followup skills.  Even though it was a non issue the customer service reps followed up with me to make sure everything was taken care of.I recently purchased their ring recording service that records every time someone pushes your door bell (I think you can probably set it to record based on motion as well).

The router is only a few feet from the ring and it has a strong/fast connection and it still manages to lose the connection and somehow confuse itself and freeze.I now own an expensive doorbell that worked great for a little while, I just don't think this thing was designed to last outside, which is a dumb thing for a company that produces doorbells.While this product was worth the purchase, I have a few issues with it:First, the whole reason  I bought this was so I could check in on the house every once in a while, and perhaps scare an unsuspecting ups person every once in a while. Well I couldn't do the latter because the delay is terrible on this thing. Everyone was gone by the time my phone would connect or even get a ''ring'' from the app.Secondly, if your connection goes out (read power outage), you can't reconnect without physically being at your house, removing it from the mount, and pressing an orange button on the back.Lastly, the sensor is finicky. Sometimes when it's windy, the ring app goes off like crazy. Other times when it's windy, it doesn't go off at all. No idea what's going on there.I decided to keep it, even with the $30 a year for cloud storage. I hope they will continue to improve the product with updates.\",\n",

It would be nice to see what kind of voltage is it receiving and the strength of the wifi signal, like the Nests\\' info screen.This would be truly awesome if it played nicely with other home automation apps, like Insteon, so you could program lights to go on with a ring of the bell, without using IFTTT.  I wish I could build a front-end app that would work with the various home automation and music apps (e.g., Sonos, receiver-specific apps, garage apps) that would integrate everything, including macros, in one interface.Outside of these \"wishes,\" the hardware and software solution are easy to use and extremely effective.

The company estimates the battery will last through 2 encounters per day which they claim is average, so 720 encounters.  However my wife and I come in and out our front door all day and each entry or exit creates an encounter so we will likely have to charge the battery more often.  I would love a feature that would somehow allow our Ring doorbell to recognize our phones when we arrive at our own door and not create an encounter.When I first installed Ring, I was able to view what was an approximation of the charge left on the battery.  That has since disappeared.As their ad states, most home burglaries are initiated by the burglar's attempt to see if anyone is home.  Where we live, our homes are all enclosed in fences, most 8 foot redwood.  So we installed Yard Lock keyless wood gate locks on both sides (http://www.yardlock.ca/).  These locks require a key code to open the gate, yet another hindrance to the home thief.

       " \"Others have commented on the operation of the Ring - and I concur with all the limitations mentioned. My comments are regarding the physicall installation.Be cautious if you're going to try and mount this on ANY surface that is not really completely flat and truly even. I'm a pretty good DIY'er and I had all kinds of problems mounting the Ring to my stucco. First, the size of the holes they want you to drill is huge and overkill for the device - be sure you're going to using/keeping Ring for a long time, because the four huge holes you'll make will be very unsightly if you ever decide to remove it - and stucco is not that easy to repair/resurface. If you have brick, this is even a bigger issue. The four mounting screws are very cheap metal and two of them broke (heads twisted off) when screwing them into the anchors. Once the mounting plate was secured, I could not get the main assembly to mount on the four locking tabs because the stucco was a bit uneven which caused the mounting plate to warp just slightly. Had to back off all the mounting plate screws quite a bit to get the body of the Ring to pair to the mounting plate - making it stick out from the wall a bit. By the way, the mounting tabs are VERY small, soft plastic, and look like they would break quite easily so be very careful of them (these tabs on the mounting plate need to be beefed up substantially - perhaps make the mounting plate out of metal VS soft plastic). The two 'securing' screws on the bottom of the body of the Ring which are there to 'secure' it to the mounting plate are minimally secure, and a big weak point in preventing someone from stealing the body of the Ring. Overall I fiddled with the whole physical install process for 4 to 6 hours (plus trips to the hardware store to replace screws, get better mollies). Installation to wood surfaces would probably go very smoothly, but if you have brick or stucco, you'd better know what you're doing when working with those types of uneven surfaces. One other post install problem; had to move our wireless access point closer to the Ring for it to work. Ring performs a LOT better with a VERY STRONG wireless signal. For the $$$, I think the mounting system for the Ring needs to be beefed up, improved and be more forgiving of slightly uneven surfaces like stucco or brick.\",\n",

Also, alter about a year, they started setting off the chime for about 10 minutes or so at 2:00 am.  They said my chime might not be compatible but why did it take a year for that to start.

       " 'This is a good product that could have been great. I suspect that software tweaks could resolve the issues, but until they are resolved I can\\'t recommend this product enthusiastically.1) The motion sensor is way too sensitive. Even after dialing it back the detection radius to 7 or 8\\', it still picks up large cars or trucks that drive past the house from roughly 80\\' away.2) The motion sensor issue cause the battery to drain much faster. Battery life is still acceptable, but nowhere near what they\\'ve advertised.3) Motion sensing to way too slow. As numerous others have said, by the time it detects motion and starts recording... It\\'s usually too late.4) The camera takes a few seconds to adjust to the current lighting conditions. The front of my house gets a lot of sunlight during the day so most of my daytime videos start completely white and slowly become viewable over the course of 2 to 5 seconds.As a doorbell alone, I\\'d give this product 5 stars without a second thought. But one of the main reasons bought it was the motion sensor. I wanted to see when deliveries were made and when my kids got home from school. As it stands, most of my notifications are cars going by. When I get a delivery, it\\'s a video of the person walking away. As for the kids, the video usually starts just in time to catch the screen door closing after they\\'ve already entered the house. That\\'s \"if\" I get a video at all. I was getting so many false positives that I set the \"smart alert\" setting to \"Light\" (receive fewer alerts).Of course, I have to add to the chorus of those who want additional functionality. The ability to activate the camera remotely would be nice, as would integration with various smart home systems. And now that they\\'ve made a solar panel to trickle charge their standalone camera, it would be nice if they made a solar panel for the doorbell too.',\n",

When the door bell rings, by the time one turns on the app to check and see who is at the door, it would time out so that one can not see who is at the door, making it useless.A word of recommendation; the product is useless unless  you intend to buy the yearly subscription.',\n",

It\\'s a really cool feature to have around the house, I had a real live test an hour after install that made my wife feel very safe to have the Ring. I just pulled up at a Home Depot parking lot to get some pool chemicals and got a notice on my phone that someone was at the front door. It was a door to door salesperson that my wife was trying to get rid of. I pressed the mic on button and spoke over the two way intercom that\\'s built in to the Ring and I told the guy \"thank you but we\\'re not interested\"...surprised them both, he took off and my wife burst out laughing! She felt safe knowing that I was able to keep an eye on her and the front door across the world on travel or just across town at the store! I had a challenge with motion sensitivity setting because of my entry orientation and trash trucks driving by, etc... but after some tweaking it now works great. Had a call with a support person and they were very professional, offered to do whatever it took to fix my problems and followed up to make sure all was well.

Don't waste your time with this buggy product.Update:  So in a last ditch effort to get this thing to work, I contacted customer service through their website, letting them know my issue was my motion sensor did not function at all even though the feature was turned on through the app.  A few days later I received an email that there was nothing they could with a generic copy and paste of the basic motion sensor information that is available on their website.

       " 'Hmmm, I\\'m trying to figure out why I don\\'t share the enthusiasm of other reviewers here.  I had the Ring app up and running pretty quickly on my Android (Lollipop) phone (a newer quad-core, very fast phone with rock-solid 4G LTE service).  The doorbell pairing with my WiFi was equally fast once I realized that I had to temporarily make my hidden network visible to do the setup.The picture quality is very good, even with backlighting.  The flashing button light and doorbell chime are great confirmations for visitors that the bell has been rung.My problem is that it sometimes takes a couple seconds to ring my phone and other times, actually MOST of the time, it takes 20 or more seconds.  When it takes that long to ring my phone, the bell returns to idle and shuts off the camera / intercom feature rendering it totally useless.  I read that there is a \"live-view\" function to turn it back on being rolled out but I don\\'t have that option.My WiFi signal is not an issue.  My phone is not an issue (I\\'ve tried it with WiFi and cellular 4G LTE).  It seems that the Ring app is rather clunky and processor intensive, resulting in slow response on the phone.  The app constantly displays, \"wait\".  Reminds me of the days of dial-up!  No thank you.***UPDATE***  After several months using this doorbell, I like it even less.  After talking to tech support, I purchased a WiFi extender and placed it inside within 5ft of the door and have a \"very good\" signal according to the Ring APP.  That said, this camera is still totally unreliable.  Most of the time it senses motion and activates just as the person is walking away so all you see is the back of the person as they walk out of the frame.  When someone rings the bell I receive notification almost immediately on the phone but, by the time the phone connects to the video on the bell, the person is usually gone - totally useless!Ring finally added a \"live view\" to the app but it is also pretty slow and unpredictable.  It usually takes 30-seconds or more to \"log in\" to the camera, often resulting in a connection failure.Finally, once every couple of months the Ring disconnects from the network for no apparent reason and will not reconnect.  That means disconnecting the entire unit and bringing it inside to run the installation program again.Again, the Ring concept is fantastic!  If this device worked, it would be amazing.  Unfortunately, it\\'s too glitchy and not ready for primetime, especially at this pricepoint.',\n",

I talked to Ring support and they have been helpful and will be sending me a new device to see if this corrects the issue.  Fingers crossed, but I will be switching to a Nest doorbell very soon.Overall this doorbell does was it says it will do. Easy to hook up both via hardwire and battery operation. The video quality is sub par and at times very glitchy. At first I thought this was due to my WiFi but I had our internet provider come and and we are running as speeds higher than needed for the doorbell. The record time needs to have settings where you can adjust the length. A lot of times by the time it adjust to the light outside the image is already gone. My neighbor has the nest which I will be switching over to. He has better quality and more options available for customization.\",\n",

I have worked with Ring support multiple times and I even changed out my internal doorbell transformer.

(We have an Asus router.)  He was unable to solve my problems and said he was going to elevate my case to a level 2 associate, and they would contact me.  That was over three days ago and I have had no word back.I\\'m giving the doorbell two stars instead of one because the concept is a good one and the doorbell itself is very attractive, but if it will \"crash\" my home network I can not use it.

My biggest issue is with my home. My front door is under an awning so you really cant see past the darker, covered area by my front door since it was soo much brighter in my driveway the video past my patio was over saturated.

There is a pro model coming out that will work on the 5ghz network so I will give that a shot.',\n",
       " 'This product is great for what we needed.  It can be power by either a battery or get wired to the low voltage wiring for the existing doorbell.  I can not testify to the how long the battery last, but I have had it up for a month and is still working fine.  The associated app tells you about the level of the batter amongst other things.  It has served well as a both a security camera and a door bell especially with the extended chime that is sold separately.  Without the extended chime, you may not hear the bell from outside, but it does ring on your phone once you have the app installed.  In regards to the app, it does allow multiple people to use it and receive the alert that someone is at the door.The only thing I do not like thus far is the monthly fee for the cloud service that is needed to store video.  It is not a substantial amount at $3.00 a month, but with all the cloud services we consumers already have, there should be a way to integrate that into our existing cloud services.  I understand it is a business model, but perhaps they can provide that capability at a price point so we can set it up to connect to our own cloud services.Despite the low monthly fee, it is still a good product and does as advertised.',\n",

I’ve also noticed problems with the doorbell portion not registering when the button is pushed. Another negative aspect is the only 30 seconds of recording time after motion is detected.

       " \"The lifetime warranty on this doorbell is the real deal. This is a very well-supported doorbell.I was having issues with holiday season package thieves and a non-working wireless doorbell. Ring is the only video doorbell I could find that will work wirelessly. The first one had battery issues. Replaced no problem. The second one had sound issues. Replaced no problem. The third on works FLAWLESSLY. I absolutely love it.The smart motion sensor works well. I see everyone who comes onto my porch, but not my neighbors' porches (three doors lined up on one big house). Two way sound is mostly good -> if it's really windy, it's hard to hear sometimes. The video is way better than I thought it would be. I can see well enough on my phone, but if I download and watch on my computer, it is very impressive.I signed up for the cloud recording - it's the least expensive pay service of any of my security cameras, and it has been reliable over the few weeks I have been using it. The doorbell is also conspicuous enough to act as a deterrent. I've had a couple of alerts where people looked like they were going to come up the steps and then changed their minds. Both my postal carrier and my UPS driver said that a lot of their stops have these, and they really like them.Bottom line: It took a couple of tries, but I am one hundred percent happy with this doorbell. If you have an issue, use the warranty. It's a real thing.UPDATE: I have a CHIME now, as well, and it also works beautifully.

       " 'I\\'ve purchased a couple of these - after trying one out first - and it\\'s a pretty useful little gadget.  Aside from the selling points, which you can read in the product description and are fairly accurate, there are a few caveats:Having a clear wireless signal visible to the doorbell is essential, as is a fairly robust broadband connection, otherwise the video doesn\\'t capture the beginning of the sequence of events triggered by either motion or the doorbell being rung.  Our ~3Mbps DSL connection did not work very well, but our ~30Mbps cable modem worked quite well, though via 100Mbps WAPs, so I\\'m not sure why the difference, but it was very noticeable when comparing the video recordings.Also, when setting up the doorbell units, be careful in your choice of wireless access points you\\'re going to use.  To change one later requires unmounting the unit from the backplane and pressing the orange button on the back, which is something you\\'ll do in the initial setup.  (In case that\\'s not clear enough:  Set your unit up before you mount it the first time!)If you have a unit set up with multiple cellphones/tablets as I do, if you want to change the default motion detection/call alert settings, you will have to change them on each phone or tablet individually - unless I missed something, which is possible as the included instructions are rudimentary although sufficient to get your units working.  If each phone or tablet can have different settings - as appears to be the case - I\\'d consider that a feature!Another unknown:  From appearances, I\\'m assuming firmware upgrades will require unmounting the unit and plugging it into your PC via the USB port on the back, although I\\'m hoping there will be in-place upgrades someday if not now.  However, if the unit\\'s not connected to a powered doorbell inside the house, you\\'ll have to do it to recharge the battery periodically.  The phone app shows how much charge remains.  Mine may not require a recharge for several months at the rate the batteries are currently dropping.But that does remind me:  Mounting the doorbell front piece to the backplane was impossible when I was trying to do it too lightly.  I eventually ended up using my half-sized carpenter\\'s level squared up on the top of the unit and a fair amount of force to get the doorbell faceplate piece to seat correctly onto the backplane - and remember to back out the set screws on the bottom before trying to mount it.  Removing the front part of the doorbell required doing the exact same thing in reverse, lifting it from underneath off of the upward facing hooks on the backplane.A very thoughtful assortment of items useful for installation comes with each unit, including various screws, putty (caulk), a screwdriver with both Philip\\'s head and the torx (I think) head needed to tighten the set screws, USB cable for charging the battery, a level (attached to the backplane) for squaring up the installation, and a reusable soft \"toolbox\" to keep them in.  There\\'s an extra screw of each type included as well!Bottom line:  A good unit with a few quirks that are useful to know about ahead of time.',\n",

You do need a decent size frame around your front door to attach the fixture to. I had to rig mine a little with a shim because the frame around my door is thin, but it works. I only worry that the fixture itself might get stolen. It seems like it would be very easy to pull off the frame or to remove with a screwdriver, but with that being said, at least I'll be able to see who does it if that were to happen.

       " \"I bought this a few months ago, looking for a way to have some video security for my front door area. This model didn't quite work for me, so I contacted Ring support. Good, but not super helpful. Everything worked and connected, just didn't stay connected to AC power. I contacted support, their response was good, but they failed to accurately identify the problem.I returned this model, and got the Ring! Pro instead (yes, it worked that well). I still had to contact support which, after much discussion it was determined the power module was bad- they sent a new one out overnight and NOW everything works beautifully!I love it!! I love being able to quickly identify who is at my door and communicate with them.Here are some things to know about my setup:1. I do have a wifi booster just inside the front door, so the wifi connection works well. If your Ring isn't staying connected to wifi, make sure your signal is good near the doorbell.2. My doorbell transformer was old- Ring works best with at least a 16v transformer. This was the original problem that Ring support missed.3. My doorbell does not face the street. It faces a small alcove, if your doorbell faces a larger area, you'll want to adjust the motion sensing area in settings so it doesn't pick up all the street motion.You will love the security and convenience! You'll probably also love it when grandkids make funny faces for your entertainment. For sure this is the doorbell to have if you're looking for added safety, security and convenience!4 stars for medium customer service.\",\n",
       " \"I am preparing to return the replacement of the original one for the same exact problem. When I connect it to my door bell wiring it works for couple of days and then it goes off the door bell power, My door bell transformer is ~ 19 volt 20 VA and I even tried 100 VA 18 Volt with same result. I do like the intercom part of this unit and prompt and ability to  talk to person that rings your bell but I had to recharge the unit twice already. I thing the problem is with the firmware of the unit and cuts out the connection to internal door bell. My complain is, direct connection to inside the house bell, I even put 19 volt 100 VA transformer instead of the 19 V 20 VA of the mechanical bell and still had no white light charging or mechanical bell ringing. I just didn't want to have to charge the unit periodical no matter how long or how short of the time it is and also the internal bell ringing since not everybody inside the house have their cellphone with them. I think your product is wonderful but it needs firmware modification to allow charging and create ringing in easier manor.Thanks\",\n",
       " 'I love it, I had no idea how many people, dogs etc go past my door everyday.  This allows me to stop the dog people who stop here instead of going to dog park.  I feel safer  as the info goes to the cloud  in the event of a break in  or worse, the family and police will see who came in.  They will replace it  if someone thinks oh boy I will steal it and no one will know I was here.  sorry, too late.  You can set it for very senstive  and it will show all or back it off. I have learned that is probably the best for me, I see all I need too, but the chimes are  not ringing all the time. I got the Ring door bell, and 2 chimes which  I have one in my bathroom, bedroom. and one in the dining room so I can hear it in the rest of the house.  you just plug them into  , go onto the app store for your phone and get the app down loaded on your smart phone, and on laptop or desktop. I feel it is a great safety feature. It has been a source of great fun also, saw lady shopping at my decorations at door when she noticted the camera and she left, saw people laughing at cat in window etc  just a good feeling  . The Ring comes with every thing you will need to set it right up , amazing',\n",
       " \"This review refers only to the original Ring. The one thing holding me back from 5 stars is the inconsistent nature of the app the first few days I had the device. The live view seemed spotty and produced a connection error 90% of attempts (this was after the initial motion event needed to activate the feature) even though the device health screen reported a great wifi connection.That said, performance has been good since and I just did a live view which worked. I feel like the value for the money is there for the original at $99 and that it works well enough for it's purpose since even when live view failed I still received event videos and could view doorbell rings when I tested. I've ordered a second along with the solar power adapter for the garage.Just to touch on setup, it was easy about as easy as it gets. I did a hardwire setup to my existing door bell. I'm about as non-handy as they get with tools and projects but it was simple. Watch the install videos and you'll be good.\",\n",
       " \"I like the idea of the Ring video doorbell and it works....some of the time.  For instance, this morning I went out to get the newspaper and Ring showed me walking across the sidewalk out to the driveway. The paper had been thrown just to the side of the house so the video lost me for a couple of seconds. Then it never picked me up again. It did not show my return trip to the front door at all.  A couple of days ago when the doorbell rang I checked my phone and saw the UPS guy ringing the bell and walking back to his truck on the street ( about 25 feet away ) but there is no video of him walking up to the house.  Occasionally , when I tap the 'live view' button the red light icon pulses but the screen is black.  The motion sensor sensitivity is fairly difficult to adjust: I have it set pretty low and it still picks up street traffic.  So, I really like the idea of Ring and all it's features but the reality , at least of this unit, seems to fall short in several ways.  I want to keep it but would not buy this unit ( the $99.00 model ) again.\",\n",
       " \"This works good for what I needed. I didn't have a peep hole so I got this and wired it where the old doorbell was. I had some johova whinesses come by while I was at work and I was able to talk to them through the ring. I liked that they thought I was inside. I also like that it records motion of who or what is going by but I had to turn down the motion sensitivy so I didn't record every car driving by or every person walking a dog by the house. At times it's a little slow connecting but that is due probably to my location not sure. Since I wired it to the old door bell it rings inside the house with the old doorbell box so that's great. I forget the turn on my schedule or change it to start motion sensing maybe after I leave for work but for now it records me leaving and coming home. It really was worth the price and has already helped me with another solicitor man who came to my door at 7pm flashed an id badge at the door and tried to sell me some water program but again I spoke to him via the talk button and sent him away. I like that it recorded him. I have only had my ring for a couple of weeks now but I think after the trial I will buy the motion monitoring fee it's affordable enough for my safety. It's best to have porch light on at night to get a clear video. In the video where I come home after I close the door you can hear the cars go by and birds chirping it's that clear. I would have given it 5 stars but it's seemed slow connecting to show me who was at the door but still worth it!\",\n",

To my knowledge there is no local access program so that i can access and save the recordings locally...  Furthermore, considering all the new information about how Facebook is using (or hacking) phones, one must wonder if Amazon is doing the same thing with Ring since they continue to save all the recordings but will not let me access them unless i pay to access which are being recorded in front of my house... very disturbing how all these devices have features which allows them to access videos and images and recordings but not allow you to save and access them on a private server or locally...I am a truck driver so, when I first ordered this Ring thing, it came in while i was out on the road, so by the time i got back and installed it, then realized the monthly fee, it was after the 30 day return window expired.I am not happy with this and I do not recommend this device.',\n",

Audio was not working. I had just upgraded my Internet speed. Installed new router, reset the Ring. Now I have Audio. Works well. It wasn't a quick setup with the phone, the interior chime didn't work so I bought the Ring one and the Audio was an issue. Now everything is working and I love it. Just have patience when you hit a snag. Please contact the company for technical questions. I bought a product. I can tell you how it works for me but can it be linked to Venus to view Mars is not in my realm of knowledge.\",\n",

And it's constantly notifying me of traffic, although the street is 30' away and I've selected all of the options available for customizing the sensitivity (setting the distance to 5-15', angling the live area to the lowest, and disabling the 2 side views). And a lot of the time it fails to record at all. I can't say this was a good investment, I'm hoping Ring will make changes to firmware or their cloud offering to improve things. I understand they're looking to add 24/7 monitoring capabilities in 2019 -- let's hope! Otherwise my review would have been 1 star.\",\n",
       " 'This device is extremely easy to set up both at the front door physically and wifi connection.The fisheye len is excellent for this camera of 720, but 1080 is better.Now come the second thing that I am not happy with the device, the automatic light adjustment from the camera. At first the picture seems ok and I am able to see depth of field at the end of the hallway and beyond, but when  the camera detects more light where it is at (right at the door), the camera adjusts to it accordingly and will adjusts to the light at the end of the hallway. It is now a big glare spot half of the hallway. There is no buttons to adjust the EV.Another thing is, it takes longer to get the alert for not being at home and on the road.Recommend Ring to build in the following as addition to the existing features:Update software for EV feature. Somehow customer is able to make adjustment to the sharpness and light.I want to give it 4 stars but 3 stars is adequate for lacking EV feature that is easy for this expensive device.I put two pictures here to demonstrate the issue.This is the update from last review.I found that after 30 days trial without paying for the service, I cannot view anything. This is not good from 200 dollars device. I will wait to see what will happen after 30 days trial is up.I would say this is the rip off.The problem is also continue in the hallway. See pictures. It has issue with light adjustment.',\n",
       " \"I struggled to decide if this was 4 stars or 5, and decided on 5.  I'm giving it some leeway because these kinds of products are *fairly* new and this one has exceeded my expectations (but it is the only video doorbell I have).  Of course, months or years from now (early 2016), these products will be smaller and better, but I'm *very* happy with this video doorbell.I installed it on part of my door frame where my existing hard-wired doorbell was located on a small piece of wood door frame.  I had to add a piece of wood to create a space wide enough to mount the whole device, but it was simple carpentry.  I took a spare piece of wood, a couple of cuts to trim the wood to fit, some screws to attach the wood piece to the existing door frame and then some paint to match the surrounding door frame.The Ring worked fine with my existing doorbell wires and existing door bell.  So Ring is always recharged and my doorbell sounds the same as it always did.I do not have the extra chime you can purchase extra.  My existing doorbell works exactly as it used to, plus all my phones and tablets ring when the Ring doorbell is pushed.  That's plenty of notification that someone is at the door, and it's all the notification I had - and more.Installation was pretty easy.  They included all the tools you need (although I used some of my own since they have bigger grips than the ones included and I have big hands).  I tested it inside my house for a while before installation, to make sure everything was OK before I started to install it.The Ring doorbell works very well.  There is a few seconds of lag between pushing the button and capturing audio; the video starts right away.  The audio delay is noticeable but doesn't bother me because it's capturing video right away.  That's great.Motion detection is adjustable and catches everyone walking on the sidewalk 20 feet from my door (as I set it up to do) as well as anyone coming all the way up to the door.  I've had it for less than a full year and I noticed the motion detection was a *little* less sensitive at first (summer).  It's very accurate now (winter).  I wondered if it's an issue with the temperature (summer vs. winter temperatures having an effect on how the Ring determines if the motion is from a person or just wind shaking a branch), or if the Ring has updated firmware - I don't know.  But it's fine right now during the winter months, and I'll know if the issue is season-dependent after the summer of 2016 (my second summer with the Ring).Ring requires a $30/year to store videos, and I think that's a very reasonable price.  The alternative would be to buy a security camera plus disk storage if I wanted to store my own videos, plus setup time and maintenance, so I don't begrudge Ring a nominal fee to store videos on their servers.  The apps and web site gives me access to the stored videos anytime, from anywhere.If you have the Ring-stored video, it would be nice if the iOS app had a multi-select to delete stored videos faster.  I've actually just gotten in the habit of not deleting anything, and I just let Ring clean up on their schedule (videos are supposed to be stored for 6 months, but I haven't checked if this is exactly the clean-up schedule).  I haven't had any issues with the video storage service or accessing any video.  You can save or share any stored videos (if you have the paid storage service).  If you don't have the service, you only get notifications and real-time video.I was worried people would be confused what to press to ring the doorbell - I didn't want them to press the camera eye.  That has not been a problem.  It's clear what to press during the day and the Ring's button has a glowing ring of light at night, so that was a concern I had, but it's not been an issue.\",\n",
       " 'This is the coolest gadget I have purchased thus far. Since I planned to do most of my Christmas shopping online I always felt a little leery about some unscrupulous individual (or individuals) partaking of the fruits of my labor so I decided to spend a couple of hundred dollars for the RING. Boy am I glad I did. The RING detects motion and notifies me (via their app) that someone is at, or near my front door. I knew (within 15 seconds or so) every time a package was delivered, and since I work 5 miles from my home I would take a break from the office and head to my house to secure my packages.Last month I got notified that someone had rang my RING doorbell. I immediately accessed the app and noticed 3 people at my front door, I pressed the \"accept\" prompt and asked, \"Can I help you?\" \"Yes, we are here to install the window blinds that you ordered from Lowes\". Dang, I totally forgot to calendar the appointment. \"I\\'m at work at the moment. Can you give me 10 minutes?\", I replied. \"Ah, sure. . . no problem. We\\'ll start unloading everything and see you when you get here\". When I did arrive the first thing he asked me was, \"Man, your doorbell is really cool. I thought you were inside your house when I initially talked with you\".The best feature of the RING is the ability to archive video footage of individuals at my front door. I can even email (or text) it to someone else. Definitely worth the $30 a year to do so.',\n",
       " \"Purchased this unit as a gift for my mom, who now lives alone.  I was able to remove the old low tech door bell and got the base of the Ring installed totally fine.  The problem is getting it synced to the app.  It tells me to plug it in, and press the orange button to get the light on the front to spin.  Nothing happens when I press the orange button ( i've even left it charge over night to see if it needed a full battery to sync- but still nothing).  Now, I can still attach it to the outside wall and have it work as a doorbell, but the camera functionality isn't available and it's turned out to be a complete headache and waste of $100.\",\n",
       " 'We have a large property and already had a 16 cameras monitoring system. But it is only useful if you happen to be looking at it. I took advantage of the discount on the First Generation Ring Doorbell and bought 7 of them.  Yes, we have that many entrances. So far I have installed 4 of them, 2 replacing existing door bells and 2 with Ring’s power supplies.  Installation couldn’t be easier.  But mostly I am blown away by the technology. Their support is also excellent. Once I get the other 3 remaining doorbells installed, I’ll probably add some of their flood lights.',\n",
       " '- I’ll admit I did not do my homework and learn just how useless this product is without the paid cloud service. Where other cameras store footage for at least a limited time period, and allow you to download/save clips, ring charges for this service. Don’t worry they make sure you pay one way or another. If you are ok with paying for yet another subscription fee, great, but here is what else I did not like about Ring:- Despite showing signal strength at the near highest level, it takes me about 10 seconds to  answer a ring. That’s if it doesn’t timeout and cancel the answer altogether. My other cameras travel further with the same obstructions and are very quick.- Since I have to charge the battery (does not fit where my power extends) I have to pop it off every couple of months to charge. One of my screws underneath began to turn with the fitting, rendering the screw useless. After chatting with support, I was shipped super glue and a new screw… to fix their hardware failure. Ridiculous. Not to mention the suggested fix did not fix it. One can only wonder if I would have been shipped a new unit should I have been a cloud subscriber.- I like the ability to snooze notifications, as I often disable my other cameras and forget. However, motion detection is still set off by large vehicles even after setting my motion zones.I basically have a $150 doorbell that I must charge every couple of months. I used to receive emails when my ring was dying, but that stopped some time ago too. Fun.',\n",

I had help from a friend that had installed one a few months back, but the instructions are easy to read and understand.

       " \"I wanted to love this product.  I bought three.  There are well-documented issues with motion detection that have been written about, but in my case now that two of three of mine don't work, I am writing this warning.  The key issue is it works for a year and then the wifi and battery diminish significantly.ONE was DEFECTIVE:  After two years and two northern winters, one of the doorbells - all are hardwired- will ring the bell but detects no motion once on its dock outside. It was permanently removed when I thankfully heard a low-level vibration from my inside doorbell unit, which thank goodness I heard before it caught fire (it was crazy hot with the constant vibration).  Not within warranty so I've got it in a box.SECOND LOSES BATTERY and WIFI:  The second one hard-wired in the same spot will not work once it gets cold.  It worked its first winter, but not now in its second. Ring says to bring it inside, so I manually charge this hard-wired unit for 8 hours and re-install outside and it gives me maybe half a day of working and then only the doorbell works.  The wifi originally was ok for LIVE VIEW but after a year it degraded and Ring sent a Chime Pro to help, but it isn't needed since the wifi router is virtually in the room next to the bell (about 10 feet away).  Live View does need the battery, so this could all be battery issues. These simply do not age well and are virtually useless in cold weather once the battery ages.\",\n",

On the 720, Night vision looks like 480, not 720 -- and it\\'s very difficult to determine who is at the door. Overall, if you want some basic coverage of your front door this is great, and you\\'ll never miss a package.  The video is good enough to figure out the faces of most people who come to visit. So if you just need basic video, buy this because $99 is amazing.  If you want top quality video, spend the extra money for the 1080.  I wish I had.',\n",

It does not record during that time until it completely turns on.  Basically, when I used this, I captured the back of everyone's head (including the mailman every day) as they walked away from my porch.  Unless they stand there for an extended time, you will not capture anyone's face.I believe the Ring pro is the only one that pre-buffers, so if you want to completely capture everything and not several seconds after motion starts, you will have to get that version.\",\n",

Product works awesome so far. If there is a criticism, I would develop a way to mass delete \"activities\"..... You\\'ll find that normal traffic in and out of your house will put several motion alerts on your app. Like emails, there should be a quick way to mass delete these alerts after they pile up over a few days.......

The installation would have been a breeze, except that my home has an existing door bell system which is wired and the button is in a standard junction box like those used for a wall switch.  The holes for mounting the Ring mounting plate are right where the screws end up in the box and the cover had to be removed to bring the wires out to connect to the Ring.  I'm a handy fabricating type of guy so I was able to make a couple of plastic plates to allow mounting.  That being said, a lot of homes use that type of button box so a simple plastic adapter could be added to the kit to address the issue.

       " 'We installed the Ring doorbell as a replacement for our analog doorbell.  It was easily installed, although we mounted the Ring to its bracket before doing the setup, which must be done before mounting.  The Ring is difficult to remove, but we were able to do so and complete the setup before remounting.  The setup is very easy and we had no problems.  We really appreciated that you can order remote add-on chimes.  We bought 3 for remote areas of our house, and they were a breeze to set up also.At this point, our Ring doorbell has been installed for about 1 month, and for the most part it works very well.  The video is very good, and we can definitely identify people when they are at the door.  In the early morning when the sun is facing directly at the camera, the video quality remains acceptable, while other cameras I have tried seem to lose color and picture quality.  I previously returned a Skybell version 2 because the picture completely washed out most of the morning.  The Ring video is comparable to a Logitech 750N camera (not a doorbell) that I have also used.Motion detection seems to not work as well as I had hoped.  The roadway by our house is more than 50 feet away from the Ring, and yet larger vans and trucks will cause the Ring to detect motion, even though I have selected a motion range inside of 30 feet.  I recommend to the Ring people that they consider a motion detection design more like the Logitech, where you can draw rectangles onto an image from the camera showing where motion should be detected.  In my case, the road appears in the top half of the image, and I would select a motion rectangle in the lower half.  Maybe this type of setting would require the on-demand feature that is promised for the future.  I am really looking forward to that feature.The add-on chimes are a good concept for us.  Their volume can be increased and decreased; we have ours set nearly to the maximum.  However, we have noticed that, although the old analog chime consistently actuates, in some cases the add-on chimes do not actuate.  Consistently, the add-on chimes did not ring if a second doorbell press occurs within the 40 second window after the first press.  So if we didn’t hear the first press, we would only hear the analog chime on the second press, and I suppose we wouldn’t hear anything at all if we did not have that old chime from the original wiring.  On occasion, the add-on chimes did not chime at all, even for the first press.  In some of those cases, the add-on chimes have actuated several minutes later.  For the record, the Ring and its chimes have good wifi connections to my network, which is connected to the internet with Xfinity’s Blast service.I am very pleased with the speed at which I receive notification on my phone, either over wifi or cellular.  Usually, the notification is within seconds of keypress, or of motion.  After the Ring notification, I can then view the current video from the Ring, within 40 seconds of the motion or keypress.  This seems to be an adequate amount of time.  Audio communications seem very reasonable, without significant delays.  In this mode, I did not find a way to instantly backup the video session to view the activity that may have set off the motion detector.  A few minutes after the video session has ended, the video session is available for playback, but if the motion is a concern, this is a long time to wait.Overall, I am pleased with the Ring, and it is serving its purpose in our house.  I really think the on-demand video feature will be a great addition to the product once it is available.  I look forward to it.  In the meantime, I hope that the issues with the chimes will be fixed and be more reliable than they are right now.',\n",

Because the Ring supposedly only requires recharging once a year, I elected to move it up and run it from battery, capping off the old wiring, which unfortunately couldn\\'t be easily rerouted.  I\\'d suggest a height of around 60\" above the ground for the best capture of faces.On some review videos I watched for this product before buying, a little orange tool kit was provided.  That must have been an earlier version.  My package arrived with the tools inset into the formed plastic packaging - there was no bag.  Probably a cost savings maneuver.  I imagine even the tools will be downsized or omitted in the future (in all fairness, most of us already have drill bits).  The images are not as good as what is shown in promos but they are not bad, and the sound is good.  Quality of the product seems good, overall.The motion sensor feature is a huge bonus.  It essentially turns the doorbell into a miniature, limited security system.  True, a thief might not go to the front door before breaking in, but in those instances in which he or she did, perhaps to see if anyone\\'s home, a video of the individual will be stored remotely and can later be accessed.  I\\'ve ordered the Chime, which I\\'ve read can be set up to send  doorbell sound throughout the house if the motion sensor is activated.  That would be another plus.I\\'m not giving this product five stars because there is no support for OSX (i.e., Mac users).  As someone who has yet to have his thumbs surgically attached to a phone, and who works from a Mac, this is a major inconvenience.  If the doorbell rings I have to find my phone or my iPad, which often is not within easy reach.  By the time I find one of them and get past the security screen and open the Ring app and click on the event the visitor will probably walked away.  I might as well have just gone to the door to open it.  According to the literature, there is Ring software for Windows 10, so it appears only Mac users have been snubbed in this regard.  If Mac support ever becomes available I\\'ll bring this review rating up to 5 stars, assuming no issues present themselves before then.Overall a great product, and even better if you\\'re not a Mac user.UPDATE after a week of use:  A few issues encountered.  First, the plate that attaches to the wall, and which the main unit mounts to, is too thin.  I have typical wood siding (horizontal planks) and it\\'s not a perfectly flat service.  Consequently, the plate deformed slightly when screwed to the surface.  Not much, but a little, and that\\'s all that\\'s required for the unit not to fasten properly to the plate.  The tiny hooks on the plate fit into slots on the unit, and if the plate isn\\'t perfectly flat, the hooks won\\'t fasten.  I literally spend two days trying to figure this out.  It was more difficult that it might sound because I had to run my old doorbell\\'s wire up the wall to a suitable height for video, and that wire necessarily has to go behind the plate to attach to the unit from the back.  After multiple failures I settled on a piece of plywood routed on the bottom to facilitate the wire.  The hooks on the plate still wouldn\\'t seat properly, though.  If the tiny (tiny!) plastic hooks must go into the tiny holes on the unit to lock it in place, the plate really should be more rigid than it is.  I finally got it to work by taking a screwdriver and gently expanding the hooks, praying the entire time I didn\\'t break one off.  I didn\\'t, and FINALLY got the unit to seat on the plate.  Now I\\'m praying I never have to remove the thing again.Also, the battery doesn\\'t last nearly as long as stated.  Prior to me hooking the unit up to trickle charge from my old doorbell wire, I ran it from the battery and it dropped from 100% to 85% in three days in 40 degree weather.  I reduced the range for the motion sensor but it continued to drop, reaching 70% only a day later. There\\'s no way it would have lasted a year on battery.  Trickle charged, though, it has maintained 100% today, so I hope that problem is solved.As others have noted, this thing is great at capturing people\\'s backsides.  I\\'ve got three videos of the mailman walking away from my porch.  None of him approaching, and this is with a wifi booster only ten feet inside the door.  I bought some wireless Chimes and there\\'s about 5 seconds between the \"real\" doorbell chime (recall that I connected this unit to my original doorbell wiring, so it does activate my old chime) and the wireless chimes.  The trade-off here is that the wireless chimes can be activated by motion, while my wired chime is only activated when someone pushes the doorbell button.  Still, as I said in my initial review, that latency added to the time it takes to find a phone/ipad, unlock it, and load the Ring app makes the thing less than ideal.  A visitor should expect to wait 15-30 seconds after ringing the doorbell before anyone inside can respond.Oddly, some motions, like a car passing by, will trigger the motion detector, while others, like me walking up to the door and going inside, won\\'t.  I can\\'t explain this but it makes the unit a little less helpful as a security tool.I don\\'t regret buying this unit but I think it will be a few years before Ring (or a competitor) really gets this right.  The reliance on the Cloud is probably the biggest drawback.  A signal from a doorbell shouldn\\'t have to bounce around the world a few times before hitting your phone.  I don\\'t mind the Cloud recording, but don\\'t see why notification of visitors can\\'t be a direct (local) signal from the unit, through your router, to your phone.',\n",
       " 'The product itself was not bad bit the fact that after a month if you dont sign up and pay a monthly fee you can only get alerts but not see the video or who is at your door was a huge disappointment and very frustrating to say the least. I thought I had done my research as I looked and did not see where it said you would be forced to pay a monthly fee to see your video after a set time. I will no longer be using mine and plan to just get another camera for my Blink system which is much better anyway and no hidden fees.']"
